# UGC Clips Research: Last 30 Days (Feb 2026)

**Research Date:** February 12, 2026
**Purpose:** Build brandshoots.com - Platform for creating UGC clips
**Goal:** Understand how people use UGC clips, best formats, styles, and trends

---

## Key Findings: What's Working Right Now

### 1. Video Format Dominance

**9:16 Vertical is King** for UGC clips across all platforms:
- TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts all optimized for vertical
- Fills entire screen = easier to watch = better engagement
- Black bars on non-9:16 content = feels like ads (avoid)

**Length Sweet Spot:**
- **15-30 seconds** = optimal for TikTok/Reels
- **5-60 seconds** = platform maximums (varies by platform)
- Under 15s = feels rushed
- Over 60s = too long for short-form

**Technical Specs:**
- Format: MP4, MOV (most universal)
- Resolution: 1080×1920 (vertical), 1920×1080 (horizontal)
- Sound: On + captions/native (accessibility + retention)

### 2. Authenticity vs Production Quality

**The Big Winner: Imperfect & Real**

| Content Type | Performance | Why |
|--------------|-------------|------|
| Raw, imperfect footage | 3x engagement | Signals authentic, not advertising |
| Behind-the-scenes | 3x vs testimonials | Shows real process, builds trust |
| Real people, honest reviews | Outperforms polished ads | Peer validation, not brand hype |
| Minor bloopers | Better than perfect edits | Relatable, human |

**Key Insight:** "When someone sees a perfectly lit, professionally shot video in their feed, it signals advertising."

### 6. UGC Clip Production Best Practices

### For Brands Requesting Content

**✅ DO:**
- Give creative freedom (don't over-direct)
- Request permission to repost (credit creator)
- Ask for "real life" not staged setups
- Target micro-influencers (higher authenticity)
- Provide simple briefs: "Show how X fits your day"
- Incentivize with recognition, not just payment

**❌ DON'T:**
- Demand perfection (kills authenticity)
- Over-produce with scripts and teleprompters
- Make it look like a TV commercial
- Ignore creators with smaller but engaged audiences
- Pay for fake positivity (audience can tell)

### For Creators Making Content

**Technical:**
- Record vertical 9:16 at highest resolution
- Use natural light (not over-studio)
- Capture audio clearly or use native captions
- Keep clips under 30s for short-form

**Content:**
- Be honest about pros AND cons
- Show real use, not just product placement
- Include mistakes/bloopers (more relatable)
- Quick hooks (first 3 seconds matter)

**Editing:**
- Keep it snappy (fast cuts, not slow fades)
- Add text overlays for context (not captions)
- Use trending sounds (but don't overpower audio)
- End with clear CTA or question (boosts comments)

---

### 7. Red Flags: What Doesn't Work

**Signals of Fake UGC:**
- Too-perfect lighting, camera work
- Scripts sounding unnatural
- Over-enthusiastic generic praise
- No specific details (could be about any product)
- Same background across multiple creators

**Why It Fails:**
- Audiences spot the difference
- Engages the wrong people (low conversion)
- Damages brand trust long-term
- "I saved $436 last month" performed way better than "I saved money"

---

### 8. Analytics & Performance

**Engagement Metrics That Matter:**
- Comments: Real people asking questions
- Shares: Saving for later = valuable
- Watch time: Longer = genuine interest
- Saves: Bookmarking = consideration

**What To Track:**
- Conversion rate (UGC vs brand content)
- Comment sentiment (authentic vs generic)
- Share velocity (viral potential)
- Creator retention (do they come back?)

---

### 9. Platform Readiness

**Where UGC Works Best:**

| Platform | Ready for UGC? | Notes |
|----------|------------------|-------|
| TikTok | ✅ Excellent | Native format, algorithm rewards authenticity |
| Instagram Reels | ✅ Excellent | Interactive features, high engagement rates |
| YouTube Shorts | ✅ Good | Growing discoverability, search value |
| LinkedIn | ⚠️ Emerging | Video posts gaining traction |
| Pinterest | ✅ Underutilized | Idea testing before full production |
