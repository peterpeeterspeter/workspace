## 🔍 Domain Analysis

### Domain Characteristics

| Attribute | Assessment | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| **TLD** | .NET | Second best after .com, but significant discount |
| **EMD status** | Partial match | "Print Shirts" is a search query, but not branded |
| **Length** | 11 chars | Medium length, acceptable |
| **Memorability** | Good | Clear, descriptive, easy to spell |
| **Brandability** | Medium | Generic, not unique |
| **SEO value** | Moderate | EMD benefit exists but diminished since 2012 |
| **Commercial intent** | High | Clear commercial purpose |

### .NET vs .COM Discount

**Rule of thumb:** .NET domains typically sell for **5-15% of .com equivalent**

**Rationale:**
- .com is the default extension (users type it automatically)
- Brand trust is lower for .net
- SEO value is similar but type-in traffic is 80%+ lower
- End-user preference strongly favors .com

## 💬 Final Recommendation

**BID IF:**
- Price <$200 and you'll build affiliate/POD site
- Price <$500 with existing traffic/revenue
- You have a specific niche/angle (local, B2B, etc.)

**PASS IF:**
- Price >$1000 without revenue proof
- Price >$500 without clear strategy
- You're not willing to invest $5K-15K in build/marketing
- You expect quick ROI (<6 months)

**ALTERNATIVE:**
Consider registering a different domain for $10-15:
- **PrintShirtsHQ.com** (branded)
- **[City]PrintShirts.com** (local)
- **[Niche]PrintShirts.com** (vertical)

**PrintShirts.net is decent but not compelling enough to justify significant investment.** The .NET extension combined with extreme market saturation makes this a moderate-at-best opportunity.
