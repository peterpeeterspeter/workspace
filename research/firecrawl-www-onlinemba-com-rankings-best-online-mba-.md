## Why Should You Get an MBA Online?

* * *

Many online MBA degrees make use of asynchronous coursework, where students can engage with lectures and discussion boards on less rigid schedules. Some courses may also run synchronously, with live web-conferencing sessions that more closely resemble in-person classroom experiences. Online programs may also require occasional campus visits for residencies, orientations, or immersion events.

Another benefit of online programs is cost-saving possibilities: Online programs do not require students to relocate and incur moving expenses. Additionally, many do not require an in-person presence, which eliminates commuting costs. Some schools offer reduced or in-state tuition for all learners, meaning an online degree can be more [affordable](https://www.onlinemba.com/rankings/affordable-online-mba/ "Most Affordable Online MBA Programs 2025") than an in-person program.

## Frequently Asked Questions About The Best Online MBA Programs

- Expand All


Yes. Many online MBA programs are purpose-built to accommodate learners balancing schooling with full-time employment. Asynchronous online courses with prerecorded lectures allow degree-seekers to study on their own schedules. Programs with synchronous real-time learning usually schedule classes on evenings and weekends to accommodate students' scheduling needs.

Most employers draw little to no distinction between an online MBA and a traditional campus-based business degree. Online learning has become normalized in the 21st century, particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, many business schools no longer specifically identify online degrees as such in diplomas or official transcripts. If you attend an accredited institution, most employers will regard your online MBA as valid.

Compared to traditional in-person programs, online MBAs are every bit as rigorous and challenging. Coursework is functionally identical, as the same professors often teach online and in-person classes for MBA programs. The only real differences relate to pacing, information delivery, and the virtual nature of interactions with peers and faculty. Though scheduling flexibility can make an online program easier to manage for students with full-time jobs, the classes still require dedication and hard work.

Online programs tend to cover 30-52 credits, which represents about two academic years of full-time study. The actual length of time it takes to graduate depends on the intensity of your learning schedule. Students in accelerated programs can graduate in as little as one year. Part-time learners typically complete their degrees in 3-5 years.

Beyond costs, student outcome data, and recruitment opportunities, the most important things to look for in an online MBA are a relevant, challenging curriculum and accreditation. Seek curricula that cover fundamental management topics. Look for schools with institutional accreditation, which verifies that a college or university meets standards for academic excellence.
