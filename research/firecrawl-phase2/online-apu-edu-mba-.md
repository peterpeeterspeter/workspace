### Education on Your Schedule

By studying online, you can earn your degree or take classes on your schedule. The
online platform allows you to complete coursework when and where it works best for
you—without sacrificing academic quality. Get the training and preparation you need
to advance in your chosen field while adapting coursework to fit into your life, not
the other way around.

### Virtual Learning Community

Our dynamic online learning community is supported by Canvas, the hub of activity
for all courses you take. In Canvas, you can connect with your professor, complete
assignments, participate in discussions, and collaborate with classmates. The interactive
experience isn’t limited by geography, so you’ll study alongside people from diverse
backgrounds and regions, enriching the knowledge you gain in your classes.

### Faith Perspective on Your Life and Calling

Wherever you are on your life journey, you have an important role to play. Your online
program at APU will encourage you to view your life and work through this lens, deepening
your faith both personally and professionally. Benefit from an online support system
that addresses not just your academic needs, but also your spiritual development.

### Low-Residency Program Options

If you like the flexibility of online studies but also enjoy in-person learning, low-residency
programs offer the best of both worlds. A number of APU graduate programs are available
in a low-residency format that entails limited campus visits for intensive learning
sessions, with the majority of the program completed online.

## Frequently Asked Questions

I’ve never taken an online course. How does it work?


Our online courses are developed and offered completely in an asynchronous format
using a learning management system called Canvas. This asynchronous format means that
you can enjoy the flexibility of accessing your courses seven days a week, 24 hours
a day, including holidays. Your online courses will have assignment due dates and
exams just like face-to-face courses.

How do online courses compare to face-to-face courses?


Both types of courses have dedicated instructors who are experts in their fields and
model Christ-centered excellence in their courses. Through discussion forums, email,
and other forms of communication, online instructors teach, mentor, advise, and interact
with you as they would in a classroom on campus. Online classroom discussions happen
in asynchronous forums instead of in a live classroom. You’ll have assignments in
both types of courses and submit your completed work online. If you have an exam in
an online course, you will take it online.

How do I participate in online classes?


Fully online courses feature several methods for interacting with your instructors
and classmates. Depending on the course, those methods can include asynchronous discussion
forums, blogs, multimedia presentations, video conferencing, email, and group projects.

How can I know if online courses are right for me?


If you are comfortable working independently, have good organizational skills, and
are self-motivated, you may find online learning to be a rewarding and satisfying
experience.

How much time do online courses take?


Online learning is not easier than learning in a face-to-face classroom. Both types
of courses pass through our rigorous academic governance process. For online and face-to-face
courses, a standard rule of thumb is 3 hours of homework time for every hour of class
time; therefore, for a three-credit course, plan on spending at least nine hours per
week on homework. The difference with online is that, instead of spending time commuting
to campus for in-person classes at specific times, you can allocate time to your schoolwork
whenever you like.

Do I need special equipment or software to be an online student?


You will need access to a computer with an internet connection. The course platform
is Canvas, and it operates within your browser such as Chrome or Firefox. Some courses
require additional software.

Do I need special technical skills to access online courses?


We recommend that students have a strong comfort level using the computer and navigating
the internet. Common skills when taking an online course include using email, attaching
files, and downloading files from the internet.

What type of support is available for online learners?
