## Domain Valuation

### EMD (Exact Match Domain) Formula

**Standard Valuation Formula:**
```
Present Domain Value = (Monthly Searches × $1 CPC) / Years to Rank #1
```

**For "Auto Loan":**
- (824,000 × $45) / 2-3 years = **$12-18 million potential**
- ✅ This is why AutoLoan.com sold for millions

**For "Vehicle Mortgage":**
- (<100 × $5) / 2-3 years = **<$200 potential**
- ❌ Essentially worthless as an EMD

### Alternative Valuation Methods

**Comparable Domain Sales:**
- AutoLoan.com - **$3-5 million** (estimated, high traffic)
- CarLoan.com - **$2-3 million** (estimated)
- AutoFinancing.com - **$500K-1M** (estimated)

**VehicleMortgages.com Estimate:**
- **Wholesale Value:** $50-150 (reg fee + slight premium)
- **Retail Value:** $200-500 (end-user who doesn't know better)
- **Investment Grade:** ❌ No (wrong terminology)

## SEO & Branding Analysis

### Exact Match Domain (EMD) Value

**When EMDs Work:**
✅ User searches the exact phrase ("auto loan")

✅ Phrase is commonly used ("car insurance")  

**When EMDs Fail:**

❌ Confusing terminology  
❌ Better alternatives exist  

**VehicleMortgages.com:**
- ❌ Users don't search for "vehicle mortgage"
- ❌ "Auto loan" is the dominant term (95%+ market share)
- ❌ Brand confusion - sounds like a mortgage product

### Brandability Assessment

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Descriptive (once explained)
- ✅ Professional sounding
- ✅ Easy to spell
- ✅ .com extension

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ **Wrong terminology** - biggest issue
- ❌ Confusing - is it a mortgage on a house with a vehicle?
- ❌ Not memorable or catchy
- ❌ Long (17 characters)
- ❌ No existing brand equity

## Competitive Landscape

### Who Owns the Valuable Domains?

**Auto Loan Industry:**
- AutoLoans.com - Major lender/lead gen
- CarLoan.com - Major lender/lead gen
- AutoFinancing.com - Major lender/lead gen

## Investment Scenarios

### Scenario A: Buy & Hold for Resale

**Probability of Profit:** ❌ <20%  
**Expected Return:** -50% to +20%

**Probability of Success:** ❌ <10%

### Scenario C: Rebrand & Pivot

**Investment:** $5K-30K (full rebrand + marketing)
