## Next Steps

1. **Decide on domain acquisition** - DropCatch auction or alternative

6. **Launch soft** - Test traffic, conversions, iterate
7. **Scale content** - 3-5 articles per week, community building

---

**Conclusion:** HorseRacingIndia.com has moderate-to-high affiliate potential as a long-term play. Success requires treating it as a premium content business, not a thin affiliate site. The Indian market is growing, online betting adoption is increasing, and high-CPC keywords offer solid monetization. However, expect 12-18 months to reach profitability, and budget accordingly for quality content and ongoing operations.
