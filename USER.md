## Goals & Context

### Primary Goal

Automate things I don't like, I'm not good at, and that AI can do better. Target: 80% automation of professional time.

### What Winning Looks Like (1 Year)
Successfully automated 80% of professional work. Spending quality time with family (Nathalie = wife, Charlie = daughter). Building scalable SaaS/marketplaces where automation does the work.

### Ideal Life
More time with family. High-leverage products that generate value 24/7. Turn experience into playbooks and systems. Mentoring next generation.
