## What Is Bitcoin Crash Game?

**Bitcoin crash game** is a crash-style gambling game where:
- You place bets in **Bitcoin (BTC)**
- A multiplier starts at **1.00x** and rises
- You **cash out** before the game "crashes"
- **Win** = bet × cashout multiplier
- **Lose** = entire bet if crash before cashout

### How It's Different from Fiat Gambling

| Feature | Bitcoin Crash | Fiat Crash |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Currency** | Bitcoin (BTC) | USD, EUR, GBP |
| **Deposits** | Crypto transfer | Credit card, bank transfer |
| **Withdrawals** | To Bitcoin wallet | Bank transfer, check |
| **Speed** | Instant (after confirmations) | 1-5 days (bank) |
| **Anonymity** | Pseudonymous | ID required |
| **Fees** | Network fees (small) | Higher payment processing |
| **Volatility** | Bitcoin price + game | Just game |
| **Regulation** | Curaçao license | UK/Malta license |

### Why Play Bitcoin Crash?

**Advantages:**
- ✅ **Fast transactions** (deposits in 10-60 min, withdrawals instant)
- ✅ **Lower house edge** (1% vs. 5-10% fiat)
- ✅ **Pseudonymous** (no ID on blockchain)
- ✅ **Global access** (play from anywhere)
- ✅ **Provably fair** (SHA-256, verifiable)
- ✅ **No bank blocks** (casinos don't block transactions)
- ✅ **Better bonuses** (100% BTC matches common)

## How Bitcoin Crash Games Work

### The Provably Fair Formula

Most Bitcoin crash games use:

```
hash_output = HMAC-SHA256(server_seed + ":" + nonce, client_seed)
crash_point = 0.99 / (1 - (hash_output / 2^52))
```

**Where:**
- **server_seed** = 256-bit random key (casino commits to hash before bet)
- **client_seed** = Your seed (you control this)
- **nonce** = Game counter (prevents result reuse)
- **HMAC-SHA256** = Cryptographic hash function
- **0.99** = House edge (1%)

### Why This Is Fair

**✅ Hash Commitment:**
- Before you bet, casino publishes: `SHA256(server_seed)`
- They can't change it later (preimage-resistant)
- Verifiable after each game

**✅ Client Seed Control:**
- You choose your own client seed
- Casino doesn't know it in advance
- Adds your randomness to equation

**✅ Independent Verification:**
- Use "Verify" button after any round
- Enter server seed, client seed, nonce
- Calculate crash point yourself
- Confirms game was fair

## Bitcoin Crash Strategies

### Strategy 1: Flat Betting (Recommended)

**Method:**
- Bet same amount each round
- Set auto-cashout to 1.5x-2x
- Don't increase bets after losses

**Why it works:**
- Minimizes volatility
- Extended playtime
- Consistent entertainment value

**Example:**
- $100 bankroll
- Bet $1 per round (1%)
- Auto-cashout at 1.5x
- Play 100-200 rounds

### Strategy 2: Bankroll Management

**Rules:**

**1% Rule:**
- Bet max 1% of bankroll per round
- Example: $100 → $1 max bet
- Prevents catastrophic losses

**Loss Limit:**
- Stop at 50% bankroll loss
- Example: $100 → stop at $50
- Prevents chasing losses

**Win Goal:**
- Withdraw at 20% profit
- Example: $100 → withdraw at $120
- Locks in gains

**Time Limit:**
- Set session: 30-60 minutes
- Take breaks every 30 minutes
- Avoids tilt

### Strategy 3: Conservative Multipliers

**Method:**
- Target 1.5x-2.5x range
- Use auto-cashout (no manual override)
- Accept frequent small wins
- Don't chase 10x+ multipliers

**Probability table:**
| Target | Win Probability | Expected Value |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1.5x | 66% | -0.5% |
| 2.0x | 49.5% | -1% |
| 3.0x | 33% | -1% |

**Insight:** Higher targets = exponentially lower win rate.

## Bitcoin Crash vs. Altcoin Crash

### Bitcoin Advantages

✅ **Most widely accepted** (all crypto casinos take BTC)
✅ **Highest liquidity** (easiest to buy/sell)
✅ **Most stable** (less volatile than altcoins)
✅ **Lower fees** (network fees smaller)
✅ **Faster confirmations** (more miners = faster)
✅ **First mover** (more established, trusted)
✅ **Best bonuses** (100% BTC matches common)

### Altcoin Considerations

**When altcoins might be better:**
- **Privacy:** Monero, Zcash (more anonymous)
- **Low fees:** Litecoin, XRP, Dogecoin (cheaper transfers)
- **Stablecoins:** USDT, DAI (avoid volatility)
- **Speed:** Solana, Terra (faster confirmations)

**Best altcoin crash sites:**
- TrustDice (accepts 15+ cryptos)
- BC.Game (50+ cryptos)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Betting Too Much Per Round

**Example:**
- $100 bankroll
- Betting $10 per round (10%!)
- Risk of ruin

**Fix:**
- Bet 1% of bankroll per round
- $100 → $1 max bet

### Mistake #2: Not Using Auto-Cashout

**Problem:**
- Manual cashout leads to greedy decisions
- "Wait for 2x...3x...5x..."
- Crash at 1.1x (lose everything)

**Fix:**
- Set auto-cashout to 1.5x-2x
- Don't override manually
- Accept small consistent wins

### Mistake #3: Ignoring Bitcoin Volatility

**Problem:**
- Your BTC value fluctuates
- Bitcoin drops 20% → your bankroll drops 20%
- Affects your betting power

**Fix:**
- Keep bankroll in **stablecoins** (USDT) if worried
- Or accept volatility (don't check price daily)
- Deposit more when BTC drops

### Mistake #4: Chasing Losses

**Pattern:**
- Lose $50
- "I'll win it back" → bet $100
- Lose again → bet $200
- Spiral into disaster

**Fix:**
- Set loss limit 50%
- Stop when hit
- Walk away, come back tomorrow
