## What to Practice: Essential Crash Skills

### 1. Cash Out Timing

**The most critical skill:**

**Exercise:**
- Start demo mode with 10,000 credits
- Place 100-credit bets
- Try cashing out at:
  - **1.5x** (conservative)
  - **2x** (moderate)
  - **3x** (aggressive)
- Track how often you'd win at each target

**Goal:** Find your comfort zone for consistent profits.

### 2. Auto-Cashout Discipline

**Auto-cashout** prevents "greedy" decisions:

**Exercise:**
- Set auto-cashout to 1.5x
- Place 100 bets at 100 credits each
- **Never override** the auto setting
- Track your final balance vs. starting balance

**Expected Result:** Small profit or break-even (due to house edge)

### 3. Understanding Variance

**Crash is high-variance:**

**Exercise:**
- Place 500 consecutive bets in demo mode
- Record:
  - Highest crash point
  - Lowest crash point
  - Number of instant crashes (1.00x)
  - Your longest losing streak

**Insight:** You'll see wild swings—this is normal variance.

### 4. Bankroll Management

**Never bet more than 1-2% of your bankroll:**

**Exercise:**
- Start with 10,000 demo credits
- Bet 100 credits per round (1%)
- Play for 100 rounds
- If bankroll drops below 5,000, **stop** (50% loss limit)
- If bankroll exceeds 15,000, **withdraw 50%** (take profits)

**Real-money translation:**
- €100 bankroll → €1-€2 per bet
- €1,000 bankroll → €10-€20 per bet

## Common Mistakes to Avoid (Practice These!)

### Mistake #1: Chasing Losses

**Scenario:** You lose 5 bets in a row. You double your next bet to "recover."

**Why it fails:**
- Crash has **no memory** (each game is independent)
- Doubling after losses (martingale) eventually hits table limits or busts your bankroll
- House edge guarantees long-term loss

**Practice solution:**
- Set a **loss limit** (e.g., stop after 10 losses)
- Stick to your base bet amount
- Accept losses as part of variance

### Mistake #2: Greedy Cash-Outs

**Scenario:** You set auto-cashout to 10x. Crash reaches 9.8x, you think "almost there!" and wait. Crash at 1.2x. You lose.

**Why it fails:**
- Probability of 10x is ~9.9% (you'll lose 90% of the time)
- Even if you win occasionally, you'll lose more often than not

**Practice solution:**
- Set realistic targets (1.5x-3x)
- Use **auto-cashout** to lock in profits
- Don't override auto settings based on "gut feeling"

### Mistake #3: No Stop-Loss

**Scenario:** You're down €500. You keep playing to "win it back." You end up down €1,500.

**Why it fails:**
- Tilt (emotional decision-making) leads to bigger losses
- Chasing losses accelerates bankroll depletion

**Practice solution:**
- Set a **session loss limit** (e.g., 50% of bankroll)
- Stop when you hit it, no exceptions
- Walk away, come back tomorrow with a clear mind

### Mistake #4: Ignoring House Edge

**Scenario:** You think "I'm due for a win" after 10 losses.

**Reality:**
- Crash games have ~1-5% house edge
- Each bet is independent (past results don't affect future outcomes)
- You're **never "due"** for a win—probability resets every game

**Practice solution:**
- Accept house edge as the "cost of entertainment"
- Focus on fun, not profit
- Set a budget and treat it like cinema tickets

## Practice Strategies to Test

### Strategy 1: Flat Betting (Low Risk)

**Method:** Bet the same amount every round, cash out at 1.5x

**Practice:**
- Place 200 bets at 100 credits each
- Use auto-cashout at 1.5x
- Track your final balance

**Expected Outcome:**
- Small loss (due to 1% house edge)
- Consistent, low-volatility gameplay

**Verdict:** Best for beginners and entertainment

### Strategy 2: Conservative Martingale (High Risk)

**Method:** Double bet after loss, reset to base bet after win

**Practice:**
- Base bet: 100 credits
- After loss: 200, 400, 800, 1,600
- Cash out at 1.5x
- Stop if you hit 5 consecutive losses (bankroll killer)

**Expected Outcome:**
- Frequent small wins
- Occasional massive loss (when hitting 5+ losses in a row)

**Verdict:** **NOT recommended** (risky, but test it yourself to see why)

### Strategy 3: Fibonacci (Medium Risk)

**Method:** Increase bets following Fibonacci sequence after losses: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...

**Practice:**
- Base unit: 100 credits
- After loss, bet next Fibonacci number
- After win, reset to base bet
- Cash out at 1.5x

**Expected Outcome:**
- Slower bet escalation than martingale
- Still dangerous if you hit a long losing streak

**Verdict:** Interesting to test, but still risky

## From Practice to Real Money: Transition Guide

### Step 1: Master the Basics (Demo Mode)

**Time:** 1-2 weeks of demo play

**Goals:**
- Understand crash game mechanics
- Test auto-cashout timing

### Step 2: Deposit Small Amount (€20-€50)

**Choose a casino with:**
- Low minimum deposit (€10-€20)

### Step 3: Set Strict Limits

**Bankroll management:**
- Total budget: €50-€100 (only what you can lose)
- Per bet: 1-2% of bankroll (€0.50-€2)
- Session loss limit: 50% (stop after losing €25-€50)
- Session win goal: 20% (withdraw €10-€20 profit)

**Tools:**
- Use deposit limits (casino self-exclusion features)
- Set session time limits (30-60 minutes)
- Take breaks (avoid tilt)

### Step 4: Track Your Results

**Record after each session:**
- Starting bankroll
- Ending bankroll
- Profit/loss
- Number of bets placed
- Biggest win
- Biggest loss
- Emotional state (tilted? calm?)

**Review weekly:**
- Are you profitable? (likely no, due to house edge)
