## Provably Fair System

### How Vera&Vegas Crash Works

Vera&Vegas uses a **transparent provably fair system**:

```
hash_output = HMAC-SHA256(server_seed + ":" + nonce, client_seed)
crash_point = 0.99 / (1 - (hash_output / 2^52))
```

### Security Features

**✅ User-Controlled Client Seed**
- You choose your own client seed
- Can change it anytime
- Prevents casino manipulation

**✅ Hash Commitment**
- Before you bet, Vera&Vegas publishes: `SHA256(server_seed)`
- Can't change server seed after commitment
- Verifiable after each game

**✅ Nonce Counter**
- Each bet uses incrementing nonce (1, 2, 3, ...)
- Prevents result reuse
- Ensures randomness

**✅ Independent Verification**
- Use "Verify" button after any game
- Enter server seed, client seed, nonce
- Calculate crash point independently
- Confirms game was fair

## Vera&Vegas Crash Strategy

### Strategy 1: Flat Betting (Recommended)

**Method:**
- Bet same amount each round
- Set auto-cashout to 1.5x-2x
- Don't increase bets after losses
- Don't decrease bets after wins

**Expected outcome:**
- Consistent, low-volatility gameplay
- Small loss due to house edge (1%)
- Extended entertainment time

### Strategy 2: Conservative Cashout

**Method:**
- Target 1.5x-2x multipliers
- Use auto-cashout (no manual override)
- Accept small wins consistently
- Don't chase 10x+ multipliers

**Mathematics:**
- Probability of 1.5x = 66%
- Probability of 2x = 49.5%
- Higher targets (5x, 10x) have <10% probability

### Strategy 3: Bankroll Management

**Rules:**
- **1% rule:** Bet max 1% of bankroll per round
- **Loss limit:** Stop at 50% bankroll loss
- **Win goal:** Withdraw at 20% profit

**Example (€100 bankroll):**
- Max bet: €1 per round
- Loss limit: Stop at €50
- Win goal: Withdraw at €120
- Session: 100-200 rounds or until limit hit
