## Provably Fair System

### How Cybet's Crash Works

Cybet uses a **transparent provably fair system**:

```
hash_output = HMAC-SHA256(server_seed + ":" + nonce, client_seed)
crash_point = 0.99 / (1 - (hash_output / 2^52))
```

**Key Features:**

**✅ User-Controlled Client Seed**
- You choose your own client seed
- Can change it anytime
- Prevents casino manipulation

**✅ Hash Commitment**
- Before you bet, Cybet publishes: `SHA256(server_seed)`
- Can't change server seed after commitment
- Verifiable after each game

**✅ Nonce Counter**
- Each bet uses incrementing nonce (1, 2, 3, ...)
- Prevents result reuse
- Ensures randomness

**✅ Independent Verification**
- Use "Verify" button after any game
- Enter server seed, client seed, nonce
- Calculate crash point independently
- Confirms game was fair

### How to Verify Cybet Crash Games

**Step 1: Before You Bet**
1. Go to "Fairness" tab
2. Copy the **server seed hash** (SHA256 commitment)
3. Choose your **client seed** (random string)
4. Note the current **nonce** (game counter)

**Step 2: After the Game**
1. Go to game history
2. Click "Verify" on any round
3. Cybet reveals the actual **server_seed**
4. Verify: `SHA256(revealed_seed) == commitment_hash`

**Step 3: Independent Calculation**
1. Use Cybet's verifier tool OR
2. Calculate manually using the formula
3. Confirm calculated crash = actual crash

**If everything matches, the game was 100% fair.**

## Crash Strategy at Cybet

### Strategy 1: Flat Betting (Recommended)

**Method:**
- Bet same amount each round (e.g., €1)
- Set auto-cashout to 1.5x-2x
- Don't increase bets after losses
- Don't decrease bets after wins

**Expected outcome:**
- Consistent, low-volatility gameplay
- Small loss due to house edge (1%)
- Extended entertainment time

**Why it works:**
- Martingale (doubling after losses) eventually hits table limits
- Flat betting minimizes risk of ruin
- Crash is high-variance; consistency helps

### Strategy 2: Conservative Cashout

**Method:**
- Target 1.5x-2x multipliers
- Use auto-cashout (no manual override)
- Accept small wins consistently
- Don't chase 10x+ multipliers

**Mathematics:**
- Probability of 1.5x = 66% (you win 2 out of 3)
- Probability of 2x = 49.5% (you win 1 out of 2)
- Higher targets (5x, 10x) have <10% probability

**Why it works:**
- Frequent small wins (dopamine hits)
- Extended playtime
- Lower risk of ruin

### Strategy 3: Bankroll Management

**Rules:**
- **1% rule:** Bet max 1% of bankroll per round
- **Loss limit:** Stop at 50% bankroll loss
- **Win goal:** Withdraw at 20% profit

**Example (€100 bankroll):**
- Max bet: €1 per round
- Loss limit: Stop at €50
- Win goal: Withdraw at €120
- Session: 100-200 rounds or until limit hit

**Why it works:**
- Prevents catastrophic losses
- Locks in profits
- Treats gambling as entertainment
