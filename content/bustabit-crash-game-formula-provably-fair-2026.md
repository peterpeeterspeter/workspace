## How Bustabit's Provably Fair Formula Works

Bustabit pioneered provably fair crash gambling with a transparent formula that every player can verify. Unlike traditional casinos where you must trust the operator, Bustabit's system lets you mathematically prove each game was fair.

### The Core Formula

Bustabit uses a simple yet elegant formula:

```
crash_point = 0.99 / (1 - (hash / 2^52))
```

Where:
- **hash** = HMAC-SHA256(server_seed + ":" + nonce, client_seed)
- **server_seed** = Secret 256-bit key generated by Bustabit
- **client_seed** = Your chosen seed (you control this!)
- **nonce** = Game counter (increases by 1 each game)

This formula guarantees:
- **Randomness:** SHA-256 hash output is uniformly distributed
- **Transparency:** You can verify every hash independently
- **No manipulation:** Server seed is committed before you bet
- **Fairness:** House edge is exactly 1% (0.99 minimum crash)

---

## Step-by-Step Verification Process

### Step 1: Before You Bet

**1. Choose Your Client Seed**
- Pick any random string (your birthday, a phrase, numbers)
- This ensures you influence the outcome
- Bustabit commits to a server seed hash

**2. Server Seed Commitment**
- Bustabit generates a random server_seed
- They publish: SHA256(server_seed)
- This **hash commitment** proves they can't change the seed later

### Step 2: During Gameplay

**3. The Formula Runs**
```
combined_string = server_seed + ":" + nonce
hash_output = HMAC-SHA256(combined_string, client_seed)
crash_point = 0.99 / (1 - (hash_output / 2^52))
```

**4. Crash Point Determined**
- If crash_point > 1.00E8 (100 million), it caps at 1.00E8
- Otherwise, crash_point is your multiplier
- Game ends when multiplier reaches this point

### Step 3: After the Game

**5. Server Seed Revelation**
- Bustabit reveals the actual server_seed
- You verify: SHA256(server_seed) matches the commitment hash
- If it matches, the game was fair

**6. Independent Verification**
- Take server_seed, client_seed, nonce
- Run the formula yourself
- Calculate the exact crash point
- Confirm it matches what you saw

---

## Why This Formula is Provably Fair

### 1. Hash Commitment Scheme

**Before you bet:**
```
commitment_hash = SHA256(server_seed)
```
- Bustabit publishes this hash
- They **cannot** find a different seed that produces the same hash (SHA-256 is preimage-resistant)
- The seed is locked in before you place your bet

**After the game:**
```
verify = SHA256(revealed_server_seed) == commitment_hash
```
- If this check passes, the seed hasn't changed
- Fairness is mathematically proven

### 2. Client Seed Influence

You control the client_seed:
- **Your seed affects the hash** (HMAC-SHA256 uses it as a key)
- **Bustabit can't predict your choice** if you pick it randomly
- **Combined with the nonce**, every game is unique
- **You verify** your seed was used correctly

### 3. Mathematical Randomness

**SHA-256 Properties:**
- **Uniform distribution:** Every hash value is equally likely
- **Unpredictable:** No way to calculate next hash from previous
- **Deterministic:** Same inputs always produce same output

**This means:**
- Crash points are mathematically random
- No patterns to exploit
- House edge is exactly 1%
- No hot or cold streaks (just variance)

### 4. Public Verification

Anyone can verify:
```
echo "<server_seed>:<nonce>" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "<client_seed>"
```

The output hash converts directly to your crash point using the formula.

## How to Verify Bustabit Games Yourself

### Manual Verification

**1. Get the Game Data**
- Server seed (revealed after each game)
- Your client seed
- Game nonce (visible in game history)

**2. Calculate the Hash**
```bash
# Using OpenSSL
echo "SERVER_SEED:NONCE" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "CLIENT_SEED"
```

**3. Convert Hash to Number**
- Take first 8 characters of hash (hex)
- Convert to decimal
- This is your hash_number

**4. Calculate Crash Point**
```
crash_point = 0.99 / (1 - (hash_number / 2^52))
```

**5. Verify**
- Does your calculated crash_point match the game?
- If yes, the game was provably fair

### Automated Verification

Use Bustabit's official verifier script:
```javascript
// Bustabit verifier (simplified)
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifyCrash(serverSeed, clientSeed, nonce) {
  const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', clientSeed);
  hmac.update(`${serverSeed}:${nonce}`);
  const hash = hmac.digest('hex');
  const hashInt = parseInt(hash.substring(0, 8), 16);
  const crashPoint = Math.floor(100 * (1 / (1 - (hashInt / 2**52)))) / 100;
  return Math.max(1.00, Math.min(crashPoint, 1e8));
}

// Example
const serverSeed = "your_revealed_server_seed";
const clientSeed = "your_client_seed";
const nonce = 12345;

console.log(verifyCrash(serverSeed, clientSeed, nonce));
```

## Common Questions About Bustabit's Formula

### Is Bustabit truly random?

**Yes.** The formula uses SHA-256, which produces cryptographically secure random output. The distribution is uniform—every crash point from 1.00x to 1,000,000x has the correct probability.

### Can Bustabit rig games?

**No.** The hash commitment scheme prevents this:
- Server seed is hashed before you bet (SHA256(seed) is public)
- Bustabit can't change the seed without changing the hash
- SHA-256 is preimage-resistant (can't reverse-engineer a seed from its hash)

### Can I predict the next crash point?

**No.** Even if you know:
- The server seed (revealed after games)
- The nonce (public counter)

You still need your **future** client seed. Since you choose this yourself, you can't predict it (unless you've pre-decided your seeds, which Bustabit allows).

### What's the house edge?

**Exactly 1%.** The 0.99 in the formula guarantees a 1% edge over infinite play. This is lower than most crash games (often 3-5%).

### Is the formula open source?

**Yes.** Bustabit's entire codebase is on GitHub. The formula, verification, and game logic are transparent.

## Red Flags: Unfair Crash Games

Avoid crash games that:
- ❌ **Don't show the formula** (black box algorithms)
- ❌ **Don't use hash commitments** (can change seeds after bets)
- ❌ **Don't let you verify** (must trust the operator)
- ❌ **House edge >2%** (Bustabit is 1%)
- ❌ **No client seed** (casino controls all randomness)

**Bustabit does all of this correctly.**

## Strategy: Playing with Mathematical Confidence

### Bankroll Management

Since the formula is proven fair, focus on:
1. **Set a budget** - Only gamble what you can lose
2. **Auto-cashout** - Lock in profits at 1.5x-2x
3. **Avoid martingale** - Doubling after losses fails due to house edge
4. **Walk away** - No "due" payouts (each game is independent)

### Understanding Variance

Even with provably fair games:
- **Short-term:** Anything can happen (streaks are normal variance)
- **Long-term:** House edge guarantees you lose ~1% per bet
- **Expectation:** E[profit] = bet_amount × (win_probability × multiplier - 1)

Example (1.5x target):
- Win probability = (0.99 / 1.5) = 66%
- Expected profit per bet = 1 × (0.66 × 1.5 - 1) = **-0.01** (1% loss)

**You can't beat the house edge, but you can prove the game is fair.**

**Q: How often does the server seed change?**
A: Every 24 hours by default (you can also change it manually).

**Q: Can I use the same client seed forever?**
A: Yes, but it's safer to change it periodically to prevent predictability.

**Q: What if the verification fails?**
A: Contact Bustabit support immediately. A failed proof means something is wrong.

**Q: Is this formula unique to Bustabit?**
A: No, but Bustabit popularized it. Many crash games now use similar systems.
