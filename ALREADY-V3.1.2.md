## Version Discovery

### What I Thought
- **Local SKILL.md:** Says v3.1.0
- **ClawHub:** Shows v3.1.2

### Reality Check
- **Actually Installed:** v3.1.2 ✅
- **Proof:** `npm list -g` shows `pinch-to-post@3.1.2`

---

## What This Means

**You're already running the latest version!**

The v3.1.2 update was already synced to your system. The SKILL.md file in your workspace (/root/.openclaw/workspace/skills/pinch-to-post/SKILL.md) just has outdated version text.

## Workspace File Update (Optional)

If you want to update the workspace SKILL.md to reflect v3.1.2:

```bash
# Update version in workspace SKILL.md
sed -i 's/v3.1.0/v3.1.2/g' /root/.openclaw/workspace/skills/pinch-to-post/SKILL.md
```

But this is cosmetic - doesn't affect functionality.

---

**Bottom line:** You're running v3.1.2 with extensive custom enhancements. Everything is up to date and working. ✅
