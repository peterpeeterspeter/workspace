## Observations & Learnings

### Process Notes
- **Heartbeat system working smoothly:** Following HEARTBEAT.md protocol correctly
- **Task tracking accurate:** Stale tasks correctly identified (Tasks 1.7, 1.8)
- **Blocker management:** Cannot unblock Peter's tasks - requiring his manual action

### What I Learned

**1. Task Staleness ≠ Urgency**
- Tasks 1.7 & 1.8 have been stale for 16+ hours
- However, they're BLOCKED on Peter (manual action required)
- Distinction: Stale ≠ Actionable. Blocked tasks wait on human input
- Learning: Report stale blocked tasks separately from urgent system issues

**2. Documentation Matters**
- Active-tasks.md updated at 00:55 UTC (good reference)
- Self-review intervals (~4h) working well for tracking
- Clear separation between stale and actionable

**3. Multi-Project Coordination**
- aimusicstore.com requires Peter's decisions (Twitter account, email tool)
- aidescribe.com requires Peter's decision (vertical validation)
- Other agents (Vision, Fury, Quill) have tasks ready but awaiting coordination
- Coordinator (Carlottta) actively monitoring but cannot unblock dependent tasks
- Learning: Create dependency map showing which tasks block others

**4. Heartbeat Protocol Efficiency**
- Following HEARTBEAT.md strictly is working well
- Quick checks (<1 min total) are efficient
- No false alarms or unnecessary reporting
- System is healthy, awaiting human decisions

## Next Actions (Recommended)

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Update active-tasks.md** with current blocker status
2. **Create dependency map** for all Phase 1 tasks
3. **Document stale task policy** for future reference

### Awaiting Peter (Action Required)
1. **aimusicstore.com decisions:**
   - Create Twitter account (Task 1.7)
   - Choose email tool (Mailgun vs ConvertKit) (Task 1.8)
   - Approve Vision/Fury/Quill to start tasks

2. **aidescribe.com decision:**
   - Validate apparel vertical via direct outreach
   - OR: Pause project until resources available
