|------|------|------|----------|----------|
| 1 | casinobeats.com | General crash guide | High DR, comprehensive | Bonuses section, not dedicated page |
| 2 | crashcasino.com | Casino homepage | EMD bonus | Actual casino, not affiliate guide |
| 3 | pokernews.com | Instant games guide | Authority site (DR 80+) | General crash games, bonus not focus |
| 4 | betmgm.com | Brand blog | Casino authority | Brand blog, not affiliate |
| 5 | esportsinsider.com | Crypto crash guide | Fresh content | Bonuses mentioned, not explained |
| 6 | vip-grinders.com | Bonus code page | Dedicated bonus code | Single casino (Crashino only) |
| 7 | stake.us | Social casino | Brand | Social casino (no real money) |
| 8 | bonus.com | Bonus guide | Bonus authority | General bonus guide, not crash-specific |
| 9 | gameshub.com | Crash sites guide | Good affiliate tables | General crash, bonuses not focus |
| 10 | ilogos.biz | Technical guide | Deep content | Game mechanics, not bonuses |

### Content Gaps Identified

**❌ Missing from competitors:**
- Dedicated "crash casino bonus" guide (most are general crash guides)
- Bonus T&Cs explained (wagering, game restrictions, max bet)
- Bonus value calculator (bonus ÷ wagering = true value)
- Bonus types comparison (welcome, no-deposit, reload, cashback)
- Claiming step-by-step with pitfalls
- Bonus strategy (bankroll + bonus alignment)

**✅ Our opportunity:**
- First comprehensive crash bonus guide
- Value-focused (not just biggest %)
- 5 affiliate tables with detailed reviews
- FAQPage schema (rich snippet opportunity)
- Calculator: "Is this bonus worth it?"

### Winning Angle

**"Don't Just Chase Bonus % — Chase Value"**

Most competitors list bonuses by size. We'll rank by **value**:
- Bonus amount ÷ wagering requirement = true value
- Example: 100%/$500 at 30x (value: 16.67) vs 200%/$1000 at 50x (value: 20)

**Content depth indicators:**
- Competitors: 800-1,200 words (general)

**Search limitation:** Rate-limited during batch analysis

**Expected competitors:**

- Honest comparison (not just "crypto is better")
- Two affiliate tables (crypto + fiat)
- Featured snippet opportunity (comparison tables)

### Winning Angle

**"Your Payment Method = Your Playing Style"**

- Formulas explained simply (not overly technical)
- Tables: Probability, EV, House Edge
- Myth-busting builds trust
- Internal link hub (SEO powerhouse)

### Winning Angle

**"Math is the Only Edge in Crash"**
