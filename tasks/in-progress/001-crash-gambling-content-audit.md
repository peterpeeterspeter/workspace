## Cross-Linking Strategy

**Decision:** Should sites link to each other?

**Pros:**
- Boosts all sites with internal links
- Shares traffic between properties
- Easier to rank network as a whole

**Cons:**
- Google may detect PBN (private blog network)
- If one site penalized, all affected
- Harder to sell individual sites later

**Recommendation:**
- **Limited cross-linking only** - when genuinely relevant
- Example: freecrashgames.com "Best Crash Casinos for China" can link to cryptocrashgambling.com "Bitcoin Crash Gambling" if relevant
- Don't force it - topical relevance must be clear
- Use natural anchor text (not exact-match keywords)
- No site-wide footer links

---

## SEO Tools Needed

**Priority:**
1. **Ahrefs or SEMrush** - For keyword volume/difficulty research
2. **Google Search Console** - Track indexing, impressions, clicks
3. **Screaming Frog** - Crawl sites for technical issues
4. **Google Analytics** - Track traffic, user behavior

**Immediate Questions:**
- Do we have Ahrefs/SEMrush access?
- Are GSC and GA set up for all 5 sites?
- Any existing backlinks to check before deleting content?

---

## Content Production Workflow

**Per Article:**
1. Keyword research (volume, difficulty, intent)
2. SERP analysis (what ranks? what format?)
3. Competitor content review (what's missing?)
4. Outline creation (structure, headers, angle)
5. Writing (1,500-2,500 words for commercial, 800-1,500 for informational)
6. SEO optimization:
   - Primary keyword in title, H1, URL, first 100 words
   - Secondary keywords in H2s, body
   - Meta description (150-160 chars, includes keyword)
   - Internal links (2-5 relevant links)
   - External links (1-3 authoritative sources)
   - Image alt text
7. Review against SEO checklist
8. Publish + submit to Google
