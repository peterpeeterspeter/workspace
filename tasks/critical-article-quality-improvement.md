## Quality Improvement Requirements

### 1. SEO & STRUCTURE (Target: 23/25)

**Must add to EVERY article:**

#### Meta Description (150-160 characters)
- Include primary keyword
- Include benefit/clickbait
- Example: "Best no-KYC crash casinos (2026). Anonymous crypto gambling sites with VPN-friendly policies, instant withdrawals, and provably fair games tested."

#### FAQ Schema
```json
{
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [{
    "@type": "Question",
    "name": "Primary keyword question?",
    "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "Detailed answer..."
    }
  }]
}
```

#### HowTo Schema (for tutorial/guide articles)
- Setup steps
- Payment methods
- Withdrawal process

#### Table of Contents Anchors
```markdown
## Table of Contents
1. [Section Name](#section-slug)
2. [Section Name](#section-slug)
```

#### Internal Links (minimum 3 per article)
Link to other published articles:
- Crash strategy guides
- Provably fair verification
- RTP/house edge explanations
- Responsible gambling resources

---

### 2. E-E-A-T (Target: 18/20)

#### Add Proof Blocks
- Anonymized wallet screenshots (placeholders OK)
- Transaction ID examples (format: txid: abc123...)
- Timestamps: "Tested on 2026-02-01, withdrawal received in 47 minutes"
- Registration date references: "Account created 2024-05-15"

#### Author Credentials
```markdown
**About the Author: Vision**

```

#### Editorial Policy
```markdown

#### Methodology Section
```markdown

2. Deposit 0.01 BTC
3. Play 50+ crash rounds
4. Request full withdrawal
5. Track processing time
6. Verify provably fair
```

---

### 3. TRUST & COMPLIANCE (Target: 18/20)

#### CRITICAL: Add Legal/Compliance Section

**For EVERY article, add:**

```markdown
## Legal & Compliance Notice

**Age Requirement:** You must be 18+ or the legal gambling age in your jurisdiction to play.

**Restricted Countries:** Crash gambling may be restricted in your jurisdiction. Not available in: United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Netherlands, and other countries with strict online gambling regulations. Always check your local laws before playing.

**AML/KYC Regulations:** While no-KYC casinos exist, reputable casinos still comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. Anonymous gambling doesn't mean illegal — it means the casino doesn't require ID for small withdrawals. Large withdrawals may still trigger verification.

**Responsible Gambling:** If you or someone you know has a gambling problem, seek help:
- GamCare: +44 (0) 8430 300 276
- Gamblers Anonymous: gamblersanonymous.org
- National Problem Gambling Helpline: 1-800-522-4700 (US)
```

#### Remove Dangerous Language
- ❌ "Under 18? Can't verify (but don't play)" → DELETE
- ❌ "No IP logging" → Change to: "No public evidence of IP profiling per T&C"
- ❌ "Bypass verification" → Change to: "Play with minimal verification"

---

### 4. CONTENT DEPTH (Target: 23/25)

#### Add Crash Metrics Table (for casino review articles)

```markdown
### Crash Game Metrics by Casino

| Casino | RTP | House Edge | Min Bet | Max Bet | Crash Games | Provably Fair | Withdrawal Time |
|--------|-----|-----------|---------|---------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| TrustDice | 99% | 1% | 0.0001 BTC | No limit | Crash | ✅ Yes | 0-1 hour |
| BitStarz | 98.5% | 1.5% | $0.20 | $5,000 | Aviator, Crash X | ✅ Yes | 1-3 hours |
```

#### Add Verification Tutorial (for provably fair articles)

```markdown
## How to Verify Provably Fair Yourself (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Find Server Seed Hash
1. Go to crash game
2. Click "Provably Fair" or "Fairness"
3. Copy the "Server Seed Hash" (before round starts)

### Step 2: Note Your Client Seed
- Your client seed: [shown in game]
- Or set your own

### Step 3: Play Round
- Cash out or wait for crash

### Step 4: Get Revealed Server Seed
- After round, casino reveals actual seed
- Copy both seeds

### Step 5: Verify with SHA-256 Calculator
1. Go to: sha256calculator.com
2. Input: server_seed + client_seed
3. Calculate hash
4. Result should match crash point
```

#### Add House Edge Math

```markdown
## House Edge Explained

**Example with TrustDice (99% RTP):**
- Bet: 0.001 BTC
- Expected return: 0.001 × 99% = 0.00099 BTC
- Expected loss: 0.001 × 1% = 0.00001 BTC per round

**Over 1,000 rounds:**
- Total wagered: 1 BTC
- Expected loss: 0.01 BTC (1% house edge)
- **This is mathematical — no strategy can overcome it long-term**
```
