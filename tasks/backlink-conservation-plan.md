## Strategy: Save Link Equity

**For pages WITH backlinks:**
1. **301 redirect** to relevant replacement content
2. OR **rewrite content** on the same URL (preserve URL, replace content)
3. Document backlink source for future outreach

**For pages WITHOUT backlinks:**
- Delete directly
- No redirect needed
