---

## 🎯 KEY DECISIONS

### 1. Site Positioning Confirmed
**Decision:** Each site gets a distinct personality to avoid duplicate content issues

**Rationale:** Competitors use thin, generic "best sites" lists. By specializing each site, we:
- Avoid duplicate content penalties
- Dominate specific keyword clusters
- Build topical authority per brand
- Create clear user funnels

**Implementations:**
- crashcasino.io = Trust/safety (legal, fairness, US market)
- freecrashgames.com = Geo-specific demo hub (emerging markets)
- aviatorcrashgame.com = Single-game authority (Aviator-only)
- cryptocrashgambling.com = Privacy/VPN/no-KYC rebuild
- crashgamegambling.com = Beginner→advanced learning path

---

### 2. Content Quality Standard
**Decision:** Minimum 1,500+ words per article, with featured snippet optimization

**Requirements:**
- Primary keyword in title, H1, URL slug, meta description
- Direct answer in first paragraph (for featured snippets)
- Tables/lists for comparisons
- 3+ internal links (contextual, not generic)
- 2+ external authority links
- 1+ original image/screenshot
- Clear CTA with affiliate code

**Featured Snippet Optimization:**
- "What is X?" format for definitions
- Step-by-step for how-to content
- Tables for comparison content
- Lists for "top/best" content

---

### 3. Internal Linking Strategy
**Decision:** Hub structure with crashgamegambling.com as central academy

**Link Flow:**
- **crashgamegambling.com** (central hub) → Links OUT to specialists:
  - "Want legal guidance?" → crashcasino.io
  - "Want to practice first?" → freecrashgames.com
  - "Obsessed with Aviator?" → aviatorcrashgame.com
  - "Privacy matters?" → cryptocrashgambling.com

- **Specialist sites** → Link IN to crashgamegambling.com:
  - Beginner guides, broad strategy, learning paths

- **No-follow policy:** Use `rel="nofollow"` on cross-site links to avoid SEO issues

**Rationale:** Hub-and-spoke model builds topical authority while directing users to appropriate specialists.

---

### 4. Monetization Integration
**Decision:** Affiliate codes embedded in ALL CTAs

**Implementation:**
- 8 partnerships documented (25-50% commission ranges)
- "PLAY NOW" buttons with bonus codes in tables
- Honest reviews with pros/cons lists
- Transparency about affiliate relationships
- Rating scores before CTAs (trust-building)

**CTA Examples:**
- "Grab up to $3,000 + 300 spins at BitStarz"
- "PLAY NOW at Cybet (50% Revenue Share)"
- "Get No-Deposit Bonus at TrustDice"
