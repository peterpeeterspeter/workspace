## Article Objective

Teach crash gamblers the math and psychology behind profitable cashout strategies. Move beyond "greed kills you" fluff and provide actionable, data-backed exit strategies.

**Target Audience:** Intermediate crash players who know the basics but lose money by holding too long. They want specific strategies, not generic warnings.

**Search Intent:** Informational with commercial intent — user wants actionable strategies to improve profitability.

## Unique Angle

**Most articles say:** "Set a multiplier and stick to it" (generic advice)

**Our angle:** Math-backed cashout strategies based on risk tolerance, bankroll management, and game volatility. Include specific multipliers for different risk profiles (conservative: 1.5x, moderate: 2x, aggressive: 3x+), auto-cashout setups, and when to deviate from the plan.

**Key insight:** The optimal cashout point isn't one-size-fits-all — it depends on your bankroll, risk tolerance, and the specific crash game's volatility profile.
