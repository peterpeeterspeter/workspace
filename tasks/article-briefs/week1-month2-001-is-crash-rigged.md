## Article Outline

### H1: Is Crash Gambling Rigged? The Uncomfortable Truth About Crash Game Fairness

**Introduction (200 words)**
- Hook: Short answer = No (at legit sites), Yes (at scams)
- Why players ask: Losses feel unfair, multipliers seem "programmed"
- What we'll cover: How crash algorithms work, how to verify fairness, red flags, safe sites
- Our stance: Transparency over hype (we'll show you the math)

### H2: How Crash Gambling Algorithms Actually Work

**Section 1: The Crash Formula (250 words)**
- Multiplier determined BEFORE round starts (not during)
- Random Number Generation (RNG) using cryptographic hashing
- Each round is independent (no memory of previous rounds)
- P(multiplier ≥ x) = 1/x (simple probability)
- Example: 1% chance of 100x, 50% chance of 2x
- **Math proof:** Show probability table

**Section 2: Provably Fair Systems (300 words)**
- What "provably fair" means
- Hash verification process (simplified):
  1. Casino generates crash point
  2. Creates cryptographic hash (hidden)
  3. You bet → round plays
  4. Hash revealed → you can verify
- Client seed vs server seed (player participation)
- How to verify yourself (step-by-step)
- **Proof block:** Example verification from a real casino

**Section 3: House Edge & RTP (200 words)**
- Crash casinos have 3-5% house edge (95-97% RTP)
- This is FAIR (better than many casino games)
- RTP comparison:
  - Crash: 95-97%
  - Blackjack: 99% (with perfect play)
  - Slots: 85-95%
  - Roulette: 94-97%
- Why you still lose long-term: House edge applies to every bet
- **Table:** RTP comparison across crash casinos

### H2: Why Crash FEELS Rigged (But Isn't)

**Section 1: Gambler's Fallacy (200 words)**
- "It's due for a high multiplier" = FALSE
- Each round is independent
- Your brain sees patterns in randomness
- Example: Streak of 1.5x crashes doesn't mean next is higher

**Section 2: Loss Aversion Bias (150 words)**
- Losses hurt more than wins feel good
- You remember the 2x crash (missed 10x) more than the 10x you caught
- Survival bias: Only big multipliers get shared on social media

**Section 3: The "Chase" Trap (150 words)**
- After a crash, you bet bigger to "recover"
- This leads to bigger losses (not rigged, just bad strategy)
- Emotional betting ≠ rational betting

**Section 2: How to Test for Rigged Games (200 words)**
