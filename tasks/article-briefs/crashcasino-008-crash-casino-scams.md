### H2: How Crash Casino Scams Work

**3 paragraphs:**
- Scammers copy legitimate crash game software (looks real, feels real)
- They manipulate the crash algorithm (more frequent early crashes)
- Or they let you win small, then block withdrawals (builds false trust)
- Lifecycle: launch → aggressive marketing → pay small withdrawals → vanish with funds

### H2: Red Flag #1: No License or Fake License

**3 paragraphs + examples:**
- Real licenses: Malta (MGA), Curacao, UKGC, Isle of Man
- Fake licenses: Costa Rica, Panama, Belize (not gambling regulators)
- How scammers fake it: stolen license numbers, fake regulator logos
- Real example: [Redacted] crash casino used a fake MGA license (verified by MGA as fake)

### H2: Red Flag #2: Crash Game Has No Provably Fair

**3 paragraphs:**
- Legitimate crash: you can verify every round (hash, seed, result)
- Scam crash: "trust us, it's fair" (no verification system)
- How rigging works: algorithm crashes more often when bets are high
- Test: play 50 rounds, track crashes. If < 2x is 60%+ of rounds, it's rigged (should be ~50%)

### H2: Red Flag #3: Unrealistic Bonuses (500%+ Match)

**3 paragraphs:**
- Legitimate bonuses: 100-200% match with 30-40x wagering
- Scam bonuses: 500-1000% match with 100x+ wagering (impossible to clear)

- Real example: [Redacted] offered 1000% bonus, zero players ever withdrew

### H2: Red Flag #4: Withdrawal Delays Over 2 Weeks

**3 paragraphs:**
- Legitimate crypto casinos: 24-48 hours
- Legitimate fiat casinos: 3-5 business days (with KYC)
- Scam tactic: "processing" forever, hope you reverse withdrawal
- Real example: [Redacted] crash casino stalled withdrawals for 90 days, then site vanished

### H2: Red Flag #5: Live Chat Goes Silent on Withdrawal Questions

**2 paragraphs:**
- Legitimate: support answers withdrawal questions honestly
- Scam: chat agents avoid, deflect, or disconnect when you ask about withdrawals
- Test script: "I requested a withdrawal 3 days ago. What's the status?" (judge response)

### H2: Red Flag #6: Terms Allow Confiscation "at Casino's Discretion"

**3 paragraphs:**
- Legitimate terms: specific reasons for confiscation (fraud, bonus abuse)
- Scam terms: vague language like "management reserves the right"
- Real example: [Redacted] casino confiscated $10k citing "suspicious activity" with no evidence

## Notes

**Angle strength:** Very strong — fills a real gap. Most crash casino content is positive/affiliate-focused. Little exists on scams.

**Legal consideration:** Be careful naming specific casinos as scams unless there's documented evidence. Use "[Redacted]" or stick to patterns, not specific accusations, unless verified.

**Affiliate opportunity:** Indirect — readers who trust our scam warnings are more likely to trust our casino recommendations.

**Future update potential:** High — new scams appear constantly. Update blacklist quarterly.

**Enhancement idea:** Create a "Scam Report" form where readers can submit suspected scams. We investigate and add to blacklist if verified.
