2. **Buy Ethereum** — Purchase ETH from exchange (Coinbase, Binance, Kraken) or use on-ramp (MoonPay, Simplex)
3. **Copy Casino ETH Address** — Casino generates unique ETH deposit address
4. **Send ETH** — From your wallet/exchange to casino address
5. **Wait for Confirmation** — ETH deposits clear in 5-15 minutes (12-30 block confirmations)
6. **Start Playing Crash** — Funds credited automatically

**Step-by-Step: Withdraw Ethereum**

1. **Go to Cashier** — Click "Withdraw" → Select "Ethereum (ETH)"
2. **Enter Your ETH Address** — Must be ERC-20 compatible
3. **Enter Amount** — Minimum withdrawal varies (0.01-0.05 ETH)
4. **Review Gas Fees** — Casino shows estimated gas fee

6. **Receive ETH** — Funds arrive in your wallet (instant to 15 minutes)

**Gas Fee Tips:**

## Ethereum Gas Fees Explained for Crash Players

**What Are Gas Fees?**

Ethereum gas fees are network transaction fees paid to validators for processing transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.

**Gas Fee Basics:**
- **Gas Price:** Cost per unit of gas (measured in gwei)
- **Gas Limit:** Maximum gas units for transaction
- **Total Fee:** Gas Price × Gas Limit = ETH fee

**Typical Gas Fees (2026 estimates):**
- **Low Traffic (10-20 gwei):** $0.50-2 per transaction
- **Medium Traffic (30-50 gwei):** $2-5 per transaction
- **High Traffic (100+ gwei):** $10-50+ per transaction

**How Gas Fees Affect Crash Gambling:**

1. **Deposits:** You pay gas to send ETH to casino
2. **Withdrawals:** You pay gas to receive ETH from casino
3. **Casino Subsidies:** Some casinos cover gas (Stake, BC.Game)

**Gas Fee Saving Tips:**
- Withdraw during low gas (check ETH gas tracker)
- Use Layer 2 solutions (Arbitrum, Optimism) — fees are 10-100x lower
- Withdraw larger amounts less frequently (consolidate withdrawals)
- Choose casinos that subsidize gas fees

**Example Withdrawal:**
- Withdrawal Amount: 0.1 ETH ($300)
- Gas Fee: 0.002 ETH ($6)
- **Net Received:** 0.098 ETH ($294)

## Ethereum vs Stablecoins for Crash Gambling

**Should You Use ETH or Stablecoins (USDT/USDC)?**

**Ethereum (ETH):**
- ✅ Potential upside (ETH price increases)
- ✅ Native blockchain token (lower fees)
- ❌ Volatility risk (ETH price drops while playing)
- ❌ Harder to track profit/loss (constantly changing value)

**Stablecoins (USDT, USDC, DAI):**
- ✅ Stable value ($1 peg)
- ✅ Easier profit/loss tracking
- ✅ Less volatility stress
- ❌ No upside potential
- ❌ Slightly higher fees (ERC-20 token transfers)

**Our Recommendation:**
- **For Casual Players:** Use USDT or USDC — stable value, easier bankroll management
- **For High Rollers:** Use ETH — potential upside, lower gas fees
- **For Grinders:** Use USDT — consistent value for tracking ROI

**Best Stablecoin Crash Casinos:**
- Stake — Supports USDT, USDC, DAI
- BC.Game — Supports all stablecoins
- Thunderpick — USDT, USDC accepted
- Metaspins — USDT, USDC supported

---

## Provably Fair Ethereum Crash Games

**What Is Provably Fair?**

Provably fair crash uses cryptographic hashing to prove game outcomes are random and not manipulated.

**How Ethereum Crash Is Provably Fair:**

1. **Server Seed** — Casino generates random seed (hashed)
2. **Client Seed** — Player provides their own seed
3. **Nonce** — Incremental counter for each round
4. **Combined Hash** — Server seed + Client seed + Nonce = crash point
5. **Verification** — Player can verify each round after playing

**Ethereum Smart Contract Crash (Advanced):**

Some crash casinos use Ethereum smart contracts for provably fair RNG:
- Crash logic deployed on Ethereum blockchain
- All outcomes recorded on-chain
- Verifiable by anyone via Etherscan
- Truly decentralized crash (casino can't manipulate)

**Casinos with Smart Contract Crash:**
- BC.Game (BC Original Crash uses smart contract RNG)
- Some decentralized casinos (dApps)

**How to Verify Provably Fair Crash:**

1. Play a round of crash
2. Copy round hash after crash
3. Use casino's provably fair verifier tool
4. Enter server seed, client seed, nonce
5. Verify crash point matches calculation

**Why Provably Fair Matters:**
- Ensures crash is truly random
- Prevents casino manipulation
- Builds trust (essential for crypto casinos)

## Responsible Gambling for ETH Crash Players

**Warning:** Crash gambling is high-risk, especially with volatile ETH.

**Unique Risks of ETH Crash:**
- **Volatility** — ETH price can drop 10-20% in hours
- **Gas Fees** — High gas eats into winnings
- **Impulse Deposits** — Easy to send more ETH when chasing losses
- **False Profit Illusion** — You win in USD but lose in ETH if price drops

**Red Flags of Problem Gambling:**
- Chasing losses (depositing more ETH to recover)
- Betting more ETH than you can afford
- Neglecting work/family for crash
- Borrowing ETH to gamble
- Lying about ETH crash losses

**Responsible ETH Crash Tips:**
1. **Set ETH Budget** — Never bet more than 1-2% of your ETH portfolio per month
2. **Use Stablecoins** — Convert ETH to USDT for crash (avoid volatility stress)
3. **Deposit Limits** — Set weekly ETH deposit limits (0.1-0.5 ETH max)
4. **Take Breaks** — Stop after 3 consecutive losses
5. **Track in USD** — Convert bets to USD for real perspective
