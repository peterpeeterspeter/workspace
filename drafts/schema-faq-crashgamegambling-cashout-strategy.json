        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "There is no universally 'best' multiplier—it depends on your risk tolerance. Lower multipliers (1.5x-2x) offer higher win rates with smaller profits per win. Higher multipliers (3x-5x+) offer larger payouts but lower win rates. Most players find 2x provides a good balance, giving approximately a 50% win rate where each win covers one loss."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Always use auto-cashout for your base strategy. Manual cashout introduces human error, hesitation, and emotional decision-making. Auto-cashout executes instantly at your predetermined target, removing psychological factors from the equation. The only exception is for extreme multipliers (50x+), where you might choose to manually override—but this should be rare, not standard practice."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The golden rule: never bet more than 1-2% of your total bankroll per round. This gives you 50-100 chances to recover from downswings before going broke. For example, with a $200 bankroll, bet $2-$4 per round maximum. Betting larger percentages increases your risk of ruin exponentially."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The 1.5x grind strategy is the safest approach: set auto-cashout to 1.5x and bet 1% of your bankroll per round. You'll win approximately 66% of rounds, creating steady small wins that offset occasional losses. While profits accumulate slowly, this approach minimizes volatility and extends your playtime. Pair with strict loss limits (20% of bankroll) and stop when ahead by 20-30% to lock in gains."

      "name": "How do I know when to stop playing crash games?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Set three hard limits BEFORE you start playing: (1) Profit target—stop when you're up 20-30% of your starting bankroll; (2) Loss limit—stop when you're down 20-30% of your bankroll; (3) Time limit—stop after a fixed duration (e.g., 30 minutes) regardless of results. Respect these limits without exception. The biggest mistake players make is ignoring stop-losses during losing streaks, hoping for a reversal that may never come."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Can I make a living playing crash games?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "No. Crash games have a built-in house edge (typically 3-5%), meaning you are mathematically expected to lose over time. Professional gamblers don't play negative-EV games. While short-term profits are possible due to variance, no crash gambling strategy can overcome the house edge in the long run. Play crash games for entertainment, not income. If you're experiencing financial problems, seek help rather than gambling."
