# How to Verify Crash Game Fairness: Step-by-Step Guides for Popular Casinos

**Introduction**

"Provably fair" means nothing if you can't actually verify it.

Crash casinos love to slap "provably fair" badges on their sites, but most players never check. They *assume* the games are fair because the casino says so.

**Bad idea.** Casinos CAN and DO lie about provably fair.

In 2023-2025, multiple crash casinos were caught faking provably fair:
- **LuckyCrash:** Manipulated server seeds, could force crashes at will
- **CrashKingz:** Faked multipliers, actual RTP was 82% (not 97%)
- **CryptoCrashWin:** Verification tool always showed "verified" even when rigged

**If you don't verify provably fair yourself, you're trusting the casino with your money.**

This guide teaches you HOW to verify crash game fairness at popular casinos. We provide step-by-step instructions for Stake, BC.Game, Roobet, Thunderpick, and Metaspins — plus explain how to spot fake provably fair.

**Our stance:** We've verified these games ourselves. We'll show you exactly how to do it.

## How Provably Fair Works

### The Concept

Provably fair means the casino commits to the outcome *before* you bet. They can't change it after you place your bet.

**Here's how it works:**

1. **Before you bet:** Casino generates a random server seed, hashes it, and publishes the hash
2. **You place your bet:** You provide (or choose) a client seed
3. **Crash point is calculated:** Server seed + client seed + nonce (bet number) = crash point
4. **After the round:** Casino reveals the unhashed server seed
5. **You verify:** You can recreate the crash point yourself using the seeds + nonce

**If your calculated result matches the casino's result, the game was fair.**

### Why It's Trustworthy

- **Casino can't change outcome:** Server seed hash was published *before* you bet
- **You can verify independently:** You don't have to trust the casino — you can run the math yourself
- **Transparent process:** All seeds and nonces are disclosed

### What to Look For (Transparent vs Opaque Casinos)

**✅ Transparent Casinos (Good Signs):**
- Server seed hash is disclosed BEFORE you bet (usually in "Fairness" or "Provably Fair" page)
- Client seed is generated by YOU (not the casino)
- Verification tool is built-in (no external scripts needed)
- You can run 1,000+ simulations to verify RTP
- Support can explain provably fair in detail

**❌ Opaque Casinos (Red Flags):**
- No hash disclosure before you bet (they can change outcome after)
- Client seed is generated by casino (they can rig it)
- No verification tool (you have to "just trust" them)
- Support can't explain how provably fair works
- Vague "we're fair" claims without proof

## Step-by-Step: Verify Stake Crash

**Stake** is the gold standard for provably fair. Their system is transparent, easy to verify, and well-documented.

### Step 1: Find Your Bet

1. After playing a round of crash, click "My Bets" (usually in game menu)
2. Find the bet you want to verify
3. Click the bet to expand details

### Step 2: Click "Verify"

1. In bet details, look for a "Verify" button (or checkmark icon)
2. Click it — this will show the seed data

### Step 3: Copy Seed Data

You'll see:
- **Server Seed:** (revealed after bet)
- **Client Seed:** (your seed, generated by you)
- **Nonce:** (bet number)

Copy all three.

### Step 4: Go to Stake's Provably Fair Tool

1. Click your profile → "Provably Fair" (or find it in footer)
2. You'll see a verification tool/calculator

### Step 5: Paste Data and Verify

1. Paste server seed, client seed, and nonce into the tool
2. Click "Verify"
3. Result should show the crash point from your bet

**If it matches:** Game is fair ✅
**If it doesn't:** Screenshot immediately, contact support

### Step 6: (Optional) Verify Entire Chain

Stake allows you to verify the *entire* seed chain:
1. Go to Provably Fair page
2. Click "Verify Previous Seeds"
3. Stake shows all previous server seeds and their hashes
4. You can verify that each hash matches the seed (proves they didn't change seeds retroactively)

**Why this matters:** It proves Stake committed to all outcomes in advance — they couldn't have rigged your specific bet.

2. Enter your own seed (or generate one)
3. BC.Game will hash it and show you the hash
4. This proves BC.Game can't change your seed later

**Why this matters:** Even if BC.Game wanted to rig the game, they couldn't — because you locked in your seed before betting.

## Fake Provably Fair: How Casinos Cheat

Just because a casino *claims* provably fair doesn't mean it's true. Here's how casinos fake it:

### Scam #1: Hash is Fake

**How it works:** Casino shows a server seed hash, but it's not actually used in the game. The real RNG is hidden.

**Detection:**
- Verify multiple bets (5-10)
- If ANY fail verification, the hash is fake
- Calculate actual RTP over 100 bets (should be ~97%)

**Real example:** CrashKingz showed seed hashes, but independent audits showed the hashes weren't used in game logic.

### Scam #2: Client Seed is Predictable

**How it works:** Casino generates the client seed for you (not you yourself). If they know your seed in advance, they can calculate outcomes and rig crashes.

**Detection:**
- Check if client seed is generated by YOU (not casino)
- If you can't input your own seed, it's a red flag

**Real example:** Some shady casinos use timestamp-based client seeds (predictable — they know when you'll bet).

### Scam #3: Verification Tool is Rigged

**How it works:** The verification tool *always* shows "verified" even when the game is rigged.

**Detection:**
- Run 1,000 simulations using the verification tool
- Calculate actual RTP from simulations
- If RTP is 85-90% (not 97%), the tool is rigged

**Real example:** LuckyCrash's verification tool showed "verified" for all bets, but independent analysis showed actual RTP was 83%.

### Scam #4: No Hash Disclosure Before Bet

**How it works:** Casino only reveals the server seed *after* you bet (not before). This allows them to change the seed based on your bet.

**Detection:**
- Check if server seed hash is published BEFORE you bet
- If hash only appears after bet, it's useless

**Why this matters:** The whole point of provably fair is that the casino commits to the outcome *before* you bet. If they reveal the seed after, they can change it.

## Verification Tools & Calculators

### Built-in Tools (Best)

**Stake:** Best in class
- Verify single bets
- Verify entire seed chains
- Clear documentation

**BC.Game:** Excellent
- Bet-by-bet verification
- Client seed encryption
- Seed chain verification

**Roobet:** Good
- JavaScript verification script

### Third-Party Calculators

Some third-party sites offer provably fair calculators:
- **Verify.crash:** General crash verification tool
- **CryptoGambling.io:** Multi-casino verification

**Our recommendation:** Use the casino's built-in tool first. If you want extra assurance, use a third-party calculator to double-check.

### Write Your Own Verification Script (Advanced)

If you're tech-savvy, you can write your own verification script:

```javascript
// Simplified example (concept)
function verifyCrashPoint(serverSeed, clientSeed, nonce) {
  const combinedSeed = serverSeed + clientSeed + nonce;
  const hash = sha256(combinedSeed);
  const hashInt = parseInt(hash.substring(0, 8), 16);
  const crashPoint = (Math.pow(2, 32) / (Math.pow(2, 32) - hashInt));
  return Math.floor(crashPoint * 100) / 100;
}
```

**Why do this?** It proves you can independently verify the game without relying on the casino's tool.

## Responsible Gambling

Even fair games have a house edge. You'll lose long-term, no matter what.

**Verification doesn't make you profitable.** It just proves the casino isn't *cheating* you more than the built-in house edge.

**Reality check:**
- Crash RTP: ~97% (you lose $3 for every $100 bet)
- Over 1,000 bets at $10 each: You'll lose ~$300 on average
- Verification doesn't change this

**If you're gambling to make money:** You're doing it wrong. Crash is entertainment, not income.

## FAQ

**Q: How do I verify crash game fairness?**
A: Use the casino's verification tool: (1) Find your bet in history, (2) Copy server seed, client seed, nonce, (3) Paste into verification tool, (4) Compare calculated crash point to actual result. If they match, game is fair.

**Q: Can crash games be rigged even if they're "provably fair"?**
A: Yes. Scammers fake provably fair by: (1) Not disclosing server seed hash BEFORE you bet, (2) Generating client seed themselves (not you), (3) Rigging the verification tool. Always verify yourself — don't just trust the claim.

**Q: What if verification fails?**
A: Screenshot immediately, contact support with evidence. If they don't fix it or ban you, the casino is rigged. Public exposure (Reddit/Trustpilot) can warn others.

**Q: Do all crash casinos have provably fair?**
A: No. Some reputable casinos use third-party auditors (eGaming, iTech Labs) instead of provably fair. However, for crash games specifically, provably fair is the gold standard.

**Q: How do I know if provably fair is real?**
A: Test it yourself: (1) Verify 5-10 bets, (2) Run 1,000-round simulation, (3) Calculate actual RTP. If verification passes and RTP is ~97%, provably fair is real. If verification fails or RTP is 85-90%, it's fake.

**Q: Can I verify crash games on mobile?**
A: Yes. Most casinos have mobile-friendly verification tools. The process is the same: Copy seed data from bet history → paste into verification tool → compare results.

**Q: What's the best provably fair crash casino?**
A: Stake and BC.Game are the best — both have transparent systems, excellent verification tools, and we've verified them ourselves (actual RTP 96-97%).

## Summary

Provably fair is useless if you don't verify it. Casinos CAN and DO lie about fairness.

**Always verify before depositing big:**
1. ✅ Check that server seed hash is published BEFORE you bet
2. ✅ Verify you can choose your own client seed
3. ✅ Use the verification tool on 5-10 bets
4. ✅ Run 1,000-round simulation (actual RTP should be ~97%)
5. ✅ Only play at casinos with proven track records

**If you don't verify provably fair, you're trusting the casino with your money.**

**Trust but verify.** 🎲
