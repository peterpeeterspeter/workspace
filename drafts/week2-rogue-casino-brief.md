- Problem: Rogue casinos rig games, refuse payouts, steal deposits
- Thesis: Learn the 7 red flags that reveal a crash casino can't be trusted

### H2: Why Crash Casinos Are Easy Targets for Scammers

**Context (200 words):**
- Crash games are code-based (easy to manipulate)
- Players can't verify provably fair systems
- Crypto casinos are unregulated (wild west)
- New crash casinos popping up daily
- Players chase "highest multiplier" offers (vulnerable)

### H2: Red Flag #1: No Provably Fair Verification

**Warning sign (250 words):**

**🚩 What It Looks Like:**
- No "provably fair" section
- Can't verify round results
- No hash chain or seed disclosure
- Vague "random number generator" claims

**Why It Matters:**
- Crash games rely on random multipliers
- Without verification, casino can control outcomes
- Honest casinos show you the math

**What Honest Casinos Do:**
- Display SHA256 hash chains
- Let you verify every round
- Explain how randomness works
- Third-party audits (e.g., iTech Labs, eCOGRA)

**Example:** BC.Game, TrustDice show provably fair systems

### H2: Red Flag #2: Refusing Legitimate Payouts

**Warning sign (250 words):**

**🚩 What It Looks Like:**
- Delaying withdrawals for "verification"
- Requesting excessive documents
- Citing vague "terms violations"
- Ignoring support tickets
- Cancelling winnings without explanation

**Why It Matters:**
- If you can't cash out, you didn't win
- Rogue casinos accept deposits but block withdrawals
- Some pay small wins, block big ones

**Real Player Complaints (anonymized):**
- "Won 2.5 BTC, casino said 'bonus abuse' and confiscated"
- "Waited 3 weeks for €500 payout, still pending"
- "Support stopped replying after I won"

**What Honest Casinos Do:**
- Process payouts in 24-48 hours
- Clear KYC requirements upfront
- Transparent withdrawal limits
- Live support response times

### H2: Red Flag #3: Fake or Revoked Gambling Licenses

**Warning sign (250 words):**

**🚩 What It Looks Like:**
- No license displayed
- Fake license logos (easy to copy)
- Licenses from non-existent regulators
- Revoked licenses not updated

**Common Fake Licenses:**
- "Curaçao Gaming" (real: Curaçao eGaming)
- "Malta Gaming Authority" (but no license number)
- "UKGC Licensed" (but no license number)

**How to Verify:**
- Check regulator's official licensee database
- Look for license number (e.g., 8048/JAZ)
- Verify license is active (not revoked)

**Reputable Licenses:**
- Malta Gaming Authority (MGA)
- UK Gambling Commission (UKGC)
- Curaçao eGaming
- Gibraltar Regulatory Authority

**What Honest Casinos Do:**

### H2: Red Flag #4: Unrealistic Bonus Terms

**Warning sign (250 words):**

**🚩 What It Looks Like:**
- 500% deposit bonuses
- €10,000 "free" credits
- 100x wagering requirements
- Max win limits (e.g., "max €100 from bonus")
- Hidden terms: "bonus abuse" = account ban

**Why It Matters:**
- Bonuses with impossible terms are traps
- You'll never withdraw winnings
- Casinos use bonuses to lock deposits

**Red Flag Terms:**
- Wagering >50x (industry standard: 30-40x)
- Max bet size €5 or less
- Game restrictions (crash games 0% contribution)
- 7-day expiry or less
- "Deposit to withdraw" requirements

**What Honest Casinos Do:**

- Reasonable expiry (14-30 days)
- No hidden max win limits

### H2: Red Flag #5: Missing or Fake Contact Information

**🚩 What It Looks Like:**
- No email address
- No physical address
- Live chat "offline" 24/7
- Contact form only (no direct reply)
- Fake addresses (e.g., "123 Fake Street, London")

**Why It Matters:**
- If things go wrong, you need to reach them
- Rogue casinos disappear when complaints pile up
- No contact = no accountability

**What Honest Casinos Do:**
- Support email (e.g., support@casino.com)
- Live chat 24/7 or 24/5
- Physical office address
- Social media presence (responds to complaints)

- "Hot" and "cold" patterns (casino controls outcomes)

**How to Spot Rigged Crash Games:**

- Look for provably fair verification
- Check independent audits

**What Honest Casinos Do:**
- Provably fair verification
