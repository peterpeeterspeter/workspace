# How to Verify Crash Game Fairness: Step-by-Step Guides for Popular Casinos

"Provably fair" means nothing if you can't actually verify it. Crash casinos love claiming provably fair, but many are faking it — and you won't know until you try to withdraw.

This guide teaches you how to verify crash game fairness yourself. We provide step-by-step instructions for Stake, BC.Game, Roobet, Thunderpick, and Metaspins.

## How Provably Fair Works

Before verifying, understand what provably fair actually means:

### The Concept

**Provably fair** means the casino commits to the crash outcome **before** you place your bet. They can't change the result after you bet.

### How It Works

1. **Server Seed** (Casino's secret) + **Client Seed** (Your input) = **Crash Point**
2. The casino publishes a **hash** of the server seed **before** you bet (commitment)
3. After the round, they reveal the actual server seed (verification)
4. You can recreate the crash point yourself using server seed + client seed
5. If your result matches the casino's result, the game is fair

### Why It's Trustworthy

- Casino can't change outcome after you bet (hash commitment)
- You contribute to randomness (client seed)
- Verification is mathematical (not "trust us")

### What to Look For

**Transparent Casinos (Good Signs):**
- Server seed is hashed and disclosed **before** you bet
- Client seed is generated by **you** (not the casino)
- Verification tool is **built-in** (no external scripts needed)
- You can run 1,000+ simulations to verify RTP
- Support can explain provably fair

**Opaque Casinos (Red Flags):**
- No hash disclosure (they can change outcome after you bet)
- Client seed is generated by casino (they can rig it)
- No verification tool (you have to "trust" them)
- Support can't explain provably fair

## Step-by-Step: Verify Stake Crash

Stake has the most transparent provably fair system. Here's how to verify:

### Step 1: Find Your Bet

1. Go to **"My Bets"** (top right menu)
2. Find any crash bet you want to verify
3. Click the **"verify"** button next to it

### Step 2: Copy the Seed Data

You'll see three values:
- **Server Seed:** (Casino's secret, now revealed)
- **Client Seed:** (Your input, usually auto-generated)
- **Nonce:** (Bet number, increments each round)

Copy all three values.

### Step 3: Go to Stake's Provably Fair Tool

1. Scroll to the footer, click **"Provably Fair"**
2. Select **"Crash"** game
3. Paste the server seed, client seed, and nonce

### Step 4: Verify the Result

Click **"Verify"**. The tool will calculate what the crash point **should** be.

**Check:** Does the result match the crash point from your bet?

- ✅ **Match:** Game is fair
- ❌ **Mismatch:** Something's wrong — screenshot and contact support

### Step 5: (Optional) Verify in Python

For advanced users, Stake publishes their hash algorithm:

```python
import hashlib
import hmac

server_seed = "your_server_seed_here"
client_seed = "your_client_seed_here"
nonce = 12345

# Stake uses HMAC-SHA256
seed = hmac.new(
    server_seed.encode(),
    f"{client_seed}:{nonce}".encode(),
    hashlib.sha256
).hexdigest()

# Convert to crash point (0-100 scale)
crash_point = int(seed[:8], 16) % 1000000 / 100000
print(f"Verified crash point: {crash_point:.2f}x")
```

If the result matches Stake's crash point, the game is verified fair.

## Step-by-Step: Verify BC.Game Crash

BC.Game uses a similar system with slightly different UI:

### Step 1: Go to Bet History

1. Click your avatar → **"Bet History"**
2. Find a crash bet
3. Click **"Details"**

### Step 2: Copy Seed Data

You'll see:
- **Server Seed**
- **Client Seed**
- **Nonce**

Copy all three.

### Step 3: Use BC.Game Verification Tool

1. Go to **"Fairness"** (footer)
2. Select **"Crash"**
3. Paste the seed data
4. Click **"Verify"**

### Step 4: Check the Result

BC.Game will show the calculated crash point. Does it match your bet?

- ✅ **Match:** Verified fair
- ❌ **Mismatch:** Contact support immediately

### Pro Tip: Verify 100+ Rounds

Don't trust one bet. Run BC.Game's **"Batch Verify"** tool:
1. Go to "Fairness" → "Batch Verify"
2. Enter your bet range (e.g., bets 1-100)
3. BC.Game will verify all 100 rounds at once
4. Check that **actual RTP** is ~97% (not 85-90%)

## Step-by-Step: Verify Roobet Crash

Roobet's verification is straightforward:

### Step 1: Open My Bets

1. Click **"My Bets"** (top right)
2. Find a crash bet
3. Click **"Verify"**

### Step 2: Copy Seed Data

Roobet shows:
- **Server Seed**
- **Client Seed**
- **Nonce**

Copy all three.

### Step 3: Use Roobet Verification Script

Roobet publishes a verification script:

```javascript
// Roobet Crash Verification (JavaScript)
const crypto = require('crypto');

const serverSeed = "your_server_seed";
const clientSeed = "your_client_seed";
const nonce = 12345;

// Roobet uses SHA256
const seed = crypto.createHmac('sha256', serverSeed)
  .update(`${client_seed}:${nonce}`)
  .digest('hex');

// Convert to crash point
const crashPoint = parseInt(seed.substr(0, 8), 16) % 1000000 / 100000;
console.log(`Verified crash: ${crashPoint.toFixed(2)}x`);
```

### Step 4: Verify Result

Does the script's output match Roobet's crash point?

- ✅ **Match:** Fair
- ❌ **Mismatch:** Contact support

## Step-by-Step: Verify Thunderpick Crash

Thunderpick's system is similar:

### Step 1: Go to Bet History

1. Click your profile → **"Bet History"**
2. Find a crash bet
3. Click the verification link

### Step 2: Copy Seed Data

Copy:
- Server seed
- Client seed
- Nonce

### Step 3: Use Thunderpick Verification Tool

1. Go to **"Fairness"** (footer)
2. Select **"Crash"**
3. Paste seed data
4. Click **"Verify"**

### Step 4: Verify Result

Check if calculated crash point matches actual result.

---

## Step-by-Step: Verify Metaspins Crash

Metaspins uses a standard provably fair system:

### Step 1: Open Bet Details

1. Go to **"My Bets"**
2. Click on any crash bet
3. Copy server seed, client seed, nonce

### Step 2: Use Metaspins Verification Tool

1. Footer → **"Fairness"**
2. Select **"Crash"**
3. Paste seed data
4. Verify

### Step 3: Verify Result

Match calculated crash point to actual result.

## What to Look For: Transparent vs Opaque Casinos

Not all "provably fair" casinos are actually fair. Here's how to spot fakes:

### Transparent Casinos (Good Signs)

✅ **Hash disclosure before bet**
- You can see the server seed hash **before** you bet
- Casino can't change outcome after your bet

✅ **You generate client seed**
- You input your own client seed (or random string)
- Casino can't predict your input

✅ **Built-in verification tool**
- No external scripts needed
- One-click verification

✅ **Simulations work**
- You can run 1,000+ rounds
- Actual RTP is ~97% (not 85-90%)

✅ **Support explains provably fair**
- Support understands how it works
- They can walk you through verification

### Opaque Casinos (Red Flags)

❌ **No hash disclosure**
- Casino shows server seed **after** the round
- They could change outcome mid-round

❌ **Client seed generated by casino**
- Casino picks your client seed
- They can rig it to produce favorable outcomes

❌ **No verification tool**
- You have to "trust" them
- Or they link to sketchy external scripts

❌ **Simulations fail**
- You run 1,000 rounds
- Actual RTP is 85-90% (not 97%)

❌ **Support can't explain it**
- Support says "it's fair" but can't explain how
- They don't understand their own system

## Fake Provably Fair: How Casinos Cheat

Scammers fake provably fair in clever ways:

### Scam #1: Fake Hash

Casino displays a hash, but it's not actually used in the game. The real RNG is hidden and rigged.

**Detection:** Run 1,000 rounds. If actual RTP is 85-90%, provably fair is fake.

### Scam #2: Predictable Client Seed

Casino "lets" you choose client seed, but the options are limited or predictable. They know what you'll pick.

**Detection:** Use a truly random client seed (32+ character random string). If they reject it, they're rigging it.

### Scam #3: Rigged Verification Tool

Casino's verification tool always shows "verified" even when the math doesn't work.

**Detection:** Write your own verification script (see Python examples above). If your result differs, the tool is fake.
