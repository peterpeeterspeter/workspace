## How Thunderpick's Provably Fair System Works

Thunderpick's crash game uses **cryptographic proof** to ensure every round is fair and random. The system combines three elements:

1. **Server Seed (Salt)** - Secret number generated by Thunderpick
2. **Client Seed** - Random number you provide
3. **Hash Function** - Cryptographic fingerprint

### The Provably Fair Process

**Before you bet:**
1. Thunderpick generates server seed (random number)
2. They SHA-256 hash the server seed
3. They display the **hashed value** (you can't see the actual seed yet)
4. This hash proves they can't change the seed later

**After the game:**
1. Thunderpick reveals the **unhashed server seed**
2. You can verify:
   - The revealed seed produces the same hash shown before the game
   - Combined seed (server + client) produced the crash point
   - Everything is transparent and verifiable

### Why This Proves Fairness

**The Hash Guarantee:**
- SHA-256 is a **one-way function** - impossible to reverse
- If Thunderpick wanted to rig the game, they'd need to:
  - Change the server seed after knowing your bet
  - But the hash would no longer match!
  - You'd catch them immediately

**The Salt + Random Combination:**
- Server seed = Thunderpick's secret
- Client seed = Your random input
- Combined = Produces crash multiplier
- Neither party can predict the outcome alone

### How to Verify Thunderpick Rounds

**Step 1:** Copy the hashed server seed before playing
**Step 2:** Generate your own client seed (or use random)
**Step 3:** After the round, get the unhashed server seed
**Step 4:** Use a verifier tool to confirm:
   - Hash matches pre-game hash
   - Crash point was calculated correctly

## Why Thunderpick Crash Games Are Fair

✅ **Transparent:** Hash shown before every round
✅ **Verifiable:** You can check the math yourself
✅ **Unpredictable:** Combined seeds make rigging impossible
✅ **Standard:** Uses industry-standard SHA-256 hashing

## Common Questions

### Can Thunderpick manipulate crash results?
No. The hashed server seed is shown before you bet, so they can't change it without breaking the hash.

### What is a "salt" in provably fair?
Salt is the server seed - Thunderpick's secret random number that gets combined with your client seed to create the crash point.

### How do I know the hash is real?
SHA-256 is a standard cryptographic function. You can hash the revealed server seed yourself and compare it to the pre-game hash.

### What if Thunderpick changes the algorithm?
The hash verification would fail. Any tampering would be immediately detectable.
