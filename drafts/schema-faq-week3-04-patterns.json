        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The mistaken belief that past random events influence future ones. Example: 'Crash hasn't hit 10x in 50 rounds, so it's due.' In reality, round 51 has the same odds as round 1."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "No. What looks like a 'hot streak' (lots of high multipliers) or 'cold streak' (lots of low multipliers) is just random clustering. It has no predictive power."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "No. Crash games use provably fair RNG. If a bot could predict crash, it would also be able to break SSL encryption and steal Bitcoin—which is impossible."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Conservative cashout (1.5x-2x) + bankroll management (1% bets). You won't beat the house, but you'll have more winning sessions than losing ones."
