Crash is unforgiving. One mistake can wipe your entire bankroll in seconds. But the good news: All 15 mistakes are fixable.

This guide categorizes mistakes by skill level, explains **why** they cost money (with math), and gives you concrete fixes.

## Beginner Mistakes (1-5)

### Mistake #1: No Auto-Cashout Set

**The error:**
You play crash, watch the multiplier climb, and manually cash out when it "feels right."

**Why it fails:**
- Human reaction time: 200-500ms delay
- Internet lag: 50-200ms
- By the time you click "cashout," multiplier has already crashed

**The cost:**
You intended to cash out at 2x. By the time you click, it crashes at 1.01x. You lose 50% of your intended profit. Repeated 10 times = 5x missed profit.

**The math:**
- Manual cashout success rate: ~70% (lag kills you)
- Auto-cashout success rate: 100% (instant, no delay)
- Missed profit per round: $10 intended profit → $5 actual loss

**Fix:**
ALWAYS set auto-cashout. Remove emotion. Remove lag. Guarantee your target multiplier.

---

### Mistake #2: Betting Your Entire Balance

**The error:**
You deposit $100, bet the full $100 on one crash round.

**Why it fails:**
One crash at 1.00x (instant crash) = entire bankroll gone. You're bust in 10 seconds.

**The math:**
- Instant crash probability: ~3% (1 in 33 rounds)
- Bet $100 once: 3% chance of total ruin
- Bet $100 ten times: 26% chance of bust (math: 1 - 0.97^10)

**Fix:**
Never bet more than 5% of bankroll per round.
- $100 bankroll → max $5 per bet
- $1,000 bankroll → max $50 per bet
- $10,000 bankroll → max $500 per bet

---

### Mistake #3: Chasing Losses Immediately

**The error:**
You lose $50. You're pissed. You bet $100 to "win it back" in one round.

**Why it fails:**
Emotional tilt → bad decisions → bigger losses → desperation → bust.

**The math:**
- Chasing pattern: Lose $50 → bet $100 → lose → bet $200 → lose → bust
- This is the "doubling down" trap. You'll go broke 80% of the time.

**Fix:**
Walk away after a loss. Minimum 30-minute break. Come back sober, not emotional.

---

### Mistake #4: Ignoring Provably Fair

**The error:**
You play crash games without verifying they're fair. "It looks legit, so it's probably fair."

**Why it fails:**
Some crash games are rigged. RTP is 85% instead of 97%. You lose 12x faster.

**The math:**
- Fair crash (97% RTP): Expect to lose $3 per $100 bet
- Rigged crash (85% RTP): Expect to lose $15 per $100 bet
- **You lose 5x faster on rigged games**

**Fix:**
Only play provably fair crash games. Verify yourself: Run 1,000 rounds, calculate RTP. If it's under 95%, leave.

---

### Mistake #5: No Max Loss Limit

**The error:**
You play until you're broke. No limit. "I'll stop when I'm up."

**Reality:**
You never stop when you're up. You stop when you're bust.

**The math:**
- No limit scenario: Deposit $100, play until $0
- With 10% loss limit: Deposit $100, stop at $90 (can recover)
- Without limit: 100% chance of eventual bust

**Fix:**
Set max loss per session: 10% of bankroll. When you hit it, STOP. Walk away.

---

## Intermediate Mistakes (6-10)

### Mistake #6: The "I'm Due" Fallacy

**The error:**
"I lost 5 rounds in a row. I'm due for a win. I'll bet big."

**Reality:**
Each crash round is independent. Past results don't influence future outcomes.

**The math:**
- Crash is 50/50 (roughly) each round
- Previous losses: 0% impact on next round
- Your chance of winning next round: Still 50%

**Cost:**
You bet bigger to "catch up" → bigger losses → faster bust.

**Fix:**
Accept independence. Each round is random. No "due" outcomes. Flat bet (same amount every round).

---

### Mistake #7: Cashing Out Too Late (Greed)

**The error:**
Auto-cashout set at 2x. You see 3x and think "I can get 5x!" You cancel auto-cashout to chase higher.

**Reality:**
Game crashes at 1.05x. You lose everything.

**The math:**
- Target: 2x (guaranteed profit if you stuck to plan)
- Greed: Chased 5x (crashed at 1.05x)
- **Greed cost: 100% of bet vs 100% profit at 2x**

**Fix:**
Set auto-cashout and NEVER touch it. Discipline > greed.

---

### Mistake #8: Cashing Out Too Early (Fear)

**The error:**
Auto-cashout set at 3x. You get nervous at 1.5x and manually cash out.

**Reality:**
Game flies to 10x. You missed 7x profit.

**The math:**
- Target: 3x ($200 profit on $100 bet)
- Actual: 1.5x ($50 profit)
- **Fear cost: $150 missed profit**

**Fix:**
Trust your strategy. Set auto-cashout based on math, not fear. Don't intervene.

---

### Mistake #9: Playing Drunk or High

**The error:**
You're drunk/high. Judgment impaired. You bet bigger, chase losses, forget auto-cashout.

**Reality:**
You make 3x more mistakes when impaired.

**The math:**
- Sober play: 5 mistakes per session
- Impaired play: 15 mistakes per session
- **Impairment triples your error rate**

**Fix:**
Only play sober. Crash requires precision. Impairment = guarantee of mistakes.

---

### Mistake #10: No Strategy, Just "Feel"

**The error:**
You bet random amounts. Cash out randomly. "I just go by feel."

**Reality:**
Feel-based betting = zero strategy = random outcomes = faster losses.

**The math:**
- No strategy: Volatile swings, -5% EV per bet
- Math-backed strategy: Consistent, -3% EV per bet
- **No strategy costs 2x more in losses**

**Fix:**
Use a math-backed strategy:
- **Conservative:** 1.5x auto-cashout, 2% of bankroll per bet
- **Moderate:** 2x auto-cashout, 3% of bankroll per bet
- **Fibonacci:** Increase bets after losses (with strict loss limit)

---

## Advanced Mistakes (11-15)

### Mistake #11: Overestimating Your Edge

**The error:**
"I have a winning strategy. I've won $500 this week. I'm profitable."

**Reality:**
You're not profitable. You're variance-positive. Long-term, house edge wins.

**The math:**
- Even optimal strategy: -3% EV per bet
- $1,000 wagered = $30 expected loss
- You're not beating the house. You're just running hot.

**Cost:**
You bet bigger because you "have an edge" → faster ruin.

**Fix:**
Accept you're playing for fun, not profit. No edge exists. House always wins.

---

### Mistake #12: Variance Blindness

**The error:**
"I won $500 in one hour! I'm a pro!"

**Reality:**
You'll lose it back next week. Variance swings both ways.

**The math:**
- Short-term (100 rounds): Can win or lose big (variance dominates)
- Long-term (10,000+ rounds): Guaranteed loss (house edge dominates)
- Your $500 win = variance. You'll lose it + more over time.

**Fix:**
Track results over 1,000+ rounds. If you're still up after 10,000 rounds, *then* we'll talk. (Spoiler: You won't be.)

---

### Mistake #13: Playing Too Long

**The error:**
You play for 4 hours straight. Fatigue sets in. You make mistakes.

**The math:**
- Hour 1: Sharp, 2 mistakes
- Hour 2: Tired, 5 mistakes
- Hour 3: Fatigued, 10 mistakes
- Hour 4: Exhausted, 15 mistakes

**Cost:**
One mistake after 3 hours = wipe out 2 hours of wins.

**Fix:**
Max 1-hour sessions. Take breaks. Fresh mind = fewer mistakes.

---

### Mistake #14: Multi-Tabling Crash

**The error:**
You play 3 crash games at once. "I'll 3x my profits!"

**Reality:**
You miss multipliers. Confusion sets in. You lose 3x faster.

**The math:**
- Single table: Focus, catch 80% of target multipliers
- Multi-tabling: Distracted, catch 40% of targets
- **Multi-tabling doubles your error rate**

**Fix:**
One game at a time. Crash requires focus.

---

### Mistake #15: Believing "Hot" or "Cold" Games

**The error:**
"This game is hot! Just hit 10x three times in a row!"
or
"It's due for a 10x. Haven't seen one in 50 rounds."

**Reality:**
Crash is random. No patterns. No hot/cold.

**The math:**
- Crash outcome = independent event every round
- Past multipliers: 0% influence on next round
- "Hot" game = random variance. "Cold" game = random variance.

**Fix:**
Ignore patterns. Each round is independent. No due outcomes.

## FAQ

### Q: What are common crash gambling mistakes?

**A:** Top mistakes: (1) No auto-cashout set, (2) Betting entire balance, (3) Chasing losses, (4) Ignoring provably fair, (5) No max loss limit, (6) Believing "I'm due" fallacy, (7) Cashing out too late/early, (8) Playing impaired, (9) No strategy, (10) Overestimating edge.

---

### Q: Why do I always lose at crash?

**A:** Crash has 3% house edge. You're *supposed* to lose long-term. But mistakes accelerate losses: No auto-cashout (missed multipliers), chasing losses (tilt), betting too big (fast bust). Fix mistakes → lose slower. Still lose, but slower.

---

### Q: Should I use auto-cashout?

**A:** ALWAYS. Manual cashout = 70% success rate (lag kills you). Auto-cashout = 100% success. Set target (1.5x, 2x, 3x), let it run, never touch it.

---

### Q: How much should I bet per round?

**A:** Max 5% of bankroll per round. $100 bankroll → max $5/bet. $1,000 bankroll → max $50/bet. $10,000 bankroll → max $500/bet. Never bet entire bankroll (one bad crash = bust).

---

### Q: Can I make a profit playing crash?

**A:** No. Even optimal strategy = -3% EV per bet. You might win short-term (variance), but long-term you'll lose. If you're up after 1,000 rounds, keep going. You won't be after 10,000 rounds.

---

### Q: What's the biggest crash gambling mistake?

**A:** Betting too big (10%+ of bankroll). One bad crash = bust. Second biggest: Chasing losses (emotional betting). Both wipe bankrolls fast. Fix: Max 5% per bet, walk away after losses.
