        "@type": "Answer",

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Look for 97%+ RTP. Lower RTP (95% or less) means a higher house edge and worse odds. 97% RTP means you lose $3 per $100 wagered on average."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Bet 1-2% of your bankroll per round, set loss limits (stop after losing 20%), and set win goals (stop after winning 50%). Never chase losses."

        "text": "1.5x - 2x is the most consistent cashout point. You'll win more often (48.5% - 65% win rate) but with smaller profits. Higher multipliers have lower win rates."
