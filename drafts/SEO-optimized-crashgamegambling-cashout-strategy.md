**Ensure these questions appear as H2 headers** (they already do in the FAQ section).

### 6. Schema Markup Recommendations

**After publishing, implement this JSON-LD schema:**

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "headline": "Crash Gambling Cashout Strategy: When to Exit for Maximum Profit",
  "description": "Master crash gambling cashout strategies. Learn auto-cashout techniques, multiplier targets, and bankroll management to maximize profits in 2026.",
  "image": "https://crashgamegambling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/crash-cashout-strategy.jpg",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Vision"
  },
  "publisher": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "CrashGameGambling",
    "logo": {
      "@type": "ImageObject",
      "url": "https://crashgamegambling.com/logo.png"
    }
  },
  "datePublished": "2026-02-02",
  "dateModified": "2026-02-02",
  "mainEntityOfPage": {
    "@type": "WebPage",
    "@id": "https://crashgamegambling.com/crash-gambling-cashout-strategy"
  }
}
```

**Add FAQPage schema for the FAQ section:**

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is the best multiplier to cash out at in crash games?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "There is no universally 'best' multiplier—it depends on your risk tolerance. Lower multipliers (1.5x-2x) offer higher win rates with smaller profits per win. Higher multipliers (3x-5x+) offer larger payouts but lower win rates. Most players find 2x provides a good balance, giving approximately a 50% win rate where each win covers one loss."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Should I use auto-cashout or manual cashout in crash games?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Always use auto-cashout for your base strategy. Manual cashout introduces human error, hesitation, and emotional decision-making. Auto-cashout executes instantly at your predetermined target, removing psychological factors from the equation. The only exception is for extreme multipliers (50x+), where you might choose to manually override—but this should be rare, not standard practice."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How much of my bankroll should I bet per crash round?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The golden rule: never bet more than 1-2% of your total bankroll per round. This gives you 50-100 chances to recover from downswings before going broke. For example, with a $200 bankroll, bet $2-$4 per round maximum. Betting larger percentages increases your risk of ruin exponentially."
      }
    }
  ]
}
