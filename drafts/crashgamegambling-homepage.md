    <section class="intro">
        <h2>Most crash gambling sites throw random articles at you. We offer a learning path.</h2>
        <p>Crash games seem simple — wait for the multiplier to rise, cash out before it crashes. But beneath that simplicity is real math, real risk, and real strategy.</p>
        <p>We built CrashGameGambling as a structured academy: start with Crash 101, learn bankroll management (the most important skill), progress through basic strategies, then level up to advanced tactics.</p>
        <p>No "guaranteed winning systems" (they don't exist). No "beat the house" scams. Just honest education for smarter play.</p>

        <h2>The Honest Truth About Crash Gambling</h2>
        <p>We're not here to sell you a dream. We're here to teach you reality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Crash games have a house edge.</strong> You cannot beat the system long-term.</li>
            <li><strong>Strategies manage risk, they don't eliminate it.</strong> Martingale, Fibonacci, D'Alembert — they all crash eventually.</li>
            <li><strong>Bankroll management is everything.</strong> Without it, you will lose. With it, you might lose slower.</li>
            <li><strong>No strategy guarantees profit.</strong> Anyone claiming otherwise is lying.</li>
            <li><strong>Responsible gambling matters.</strong> Set limits. Stick to them. Walk away.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If we sound pessimistic, good. Crash gambling is risky. Pretending otherwise is dishonest.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="responsible">
        <h2>Responsible Gambling</h2>
