## Introduction

Most affiliate sites won't tell you this: **We earn money when you sign up.**

Here's how we keep our ratings honest.

You can't trust casino ratings if you don't know the criteria. Most affiliate sites say "we're #1!" without explaining WHY. They rate casinos on shallow metrics (bonuses, games, "trust") while hiding their commission structure.

We're different. We explain **exactly** how we rate crash casinos, what we test, and our affiliate relationship. We promise: We only recommend casinos we'd play at ourselves.

**Our rating philosophy:** Transparency over profit. We've blacklisted casinos that pay high commissions because they failed our tests. Honesty beats quick money.

## Our Rating Criteria (Crash-Specific)

We rate crash casinos on **9 crash-specific criteria**. Each criterion has a weight (percentage of total score). This isn't generic — we test what actually matters to crash players.

### Criteria #1: Provably Fair Verification (20% of score)

**What we check:**
- Can we verify the crash game ourselves?
- Hash disclosure before betting?
- Client seed generated by player?
- Built-in verification tool?
- Actual RTP when we test 1,000+ rounds?

**How we test:**
1. We create real accounts
2. We play 100+ rounds
3. We copy server seed, client seed, nonce
4. We run verification using the casino's tool
5. We run 1,000 simulated rounds
6. We calculate actual RTP (should be 96-98%)

**Red flags:**
- No hash disclosure before betting
- No verification tool
- Client seed generated by casino
- RTP below 95% (rigged game)
- Support can't explain provably fair

**Why it matters (20% weight):**

If the game is rigged, nothing else matters. You can have great bonuses, fast withdrawals, and excellent support — but if the crash game is rigged, you'll lose 4x faster.

---

### Criteria #2: Licensing & Regulation (15% of score)

**What we check:**
- License type: Curacao, MGA (Malta), UKGC, or unlicensed?
- License verified on regulator website?
- License active (not expired)?
- License covers crash games?

**How we verify:**
1. We check the casino's footer for license number
2. We search the license number on the regulator's site:
   - Curacao: [curacaogaming.org](https://www.curacaogaming.org)
   - MGA: [mga.org.mt](https://www.mga.org.mt)
   - UKGC: [gamblingcommission.gov.uk](https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk)
3. We confirm the license is active

**Red flags:**
- No license displayed
- Fake license (number doesn't match regulator records)
- Expired license
- License doesn't cover crash games

**Why it matters (15% weight):**

Licensed casinos have oversight. Regulators can investigate complaints, enforce payouts, and revoke licenses. Unlicensed casinos can disappear with your funds.

---

### Criteria #3: Crash Game Variety (10% of score)

**What we check:**
- Number of crash games available
- Variety: Aviator, Crash X, SpaceXY, multi-player crash?
- Game quality (lag, graphics, mobile)?
- Unique crash variants (not just clones)?

**How we test:**
1. We play every crash game on the site
2. We note lag, auto-cashout reliability, mobile performance
3. We compare variety to competitors

**Red flags:**
- Only 1 crash game (limited)
- Cloned games (copy-paste of Aviator)
- Crash games lag or crash on mobile

**Why it matters (10% weight):**

Variety keeps gameplay fresh. If you play crash daily, you want options. One crash game gets boring after 100 rounds.

---

### Criteria #4: Withdrawal Speed & Reliability (15% of score)

**What we check:**
- How fast do they pay? (Instant, 1 hour, 24 hours, 7 days?)
- Do they actually pay? (Any unpaid complaints?)
- Withdrawal limits? (Min/max, weekly caps?)
- Crypto vs fiat speed?

**How we test:**
1. We deposit $50-200 of our own money
2. We play crash, win/lose, request withdrawal
3. We time how long it takes (casino processing + blockchain)
4. We verify the funds hit our wallet

**Red flags:**
- Withdrawal takes 7+ days
- Withdrawal refused (bonus abuse excuses)
- "Pending" status for weeks
- Multiple unpaid withdrawal complaints on Trustpilot

**Why it matters (15% weight):**

Fast withdrawals = trustworthy casino. If a casino pays within 24 hours, they're confident in their liquidity. If they take 7+ days, they're probably stalling or insolvent.

---

### Criteria #5: Bonuses (Fair Wagering) (10% of score)

**What we check:**
- Welcome bonus amount?
- Wagering requirement? (20x, 50x, 100x?)
- Bonus effective value? (Bonus ÷ wagering)
- Max cashout limits?
- Crash game restrictions?

**How we calculate effective value:**

Example:
- Bonus: $100
- Wagering: 50x
- Effective value = $100 ÷ 50 = $2 per $100 wagered
- **This is terrible.** Bonus is useless.

Good bonus:
- Bonus: $50
- Wagering: 30x
- Effective value = $50 ÷ 30 = $1.67 per $100 wagered
- **Still not great, but playable.**

**Red flags:**
- 100x wagering or higher
- "Unlimited" bonuses (scam)
- Crash games contribute 0% to wagering
- Max cashout is 3x deposit (can't profit)

**Why it matters (10% weight):**

Good bonuses = extra play. But only if wagering is fair. Unfair bonuses are traps — you'll never withdraw.

---

### Criteria #6: User Reviews & Reputation (15% of score)

**What we check:**
- Trustpilot rating (8+ is good, below 5 is bad)
- Reddit threads (r/gambling, r/crashgambling)
- AskGamblers complaints
- Overall reputation (2+ years of operation?)

**How we test:**
1. We read 100+ Trustpilot reviews
2. We search Reddit for "[Casino Name] scam"
3. We check AskGamblers for unresolved complaints
4. We note patterns (multiple players saying "scam" = avoid)

**Red flags:**
- Trustpilot rating below 4.0
- Multiple "scam" reviews
- Unresolved complaints on AskGamblers
- Casino launched <6 months ago (untested)

**Why it matters (15% weight):**

If players hate a casino, we won't recommend it. Reputation is earned — and lost.

---

### Criteria #7: Customer Support (5% of score)

**What we check:**
- Live chat availability? (24/7 or limited hours?)
- Response time? (Instant, 5 minutes, 24 hours?)
- Support quality? (Helpful or clueless?)
- Multiple channels? (Chat, email, Discord?)

**How we test:**
1. We ask 5 questions via live chat:
   - "Is your crash game provably fair?"
   - "How do I verify a bet?"
   - "What are your withdrawal limits?"
   - "What's your wagering requirement?"
   - "Can I play crash on mobile?"
2. We time responses
3. We rate answer quality

**Red flags:**
- Bot-only support (no humans)
- 24+ hour response time
- Support can't answer basic questions
- Rude or dismissive support

**Why it matters (5% weight):**

When something goes wrong, you need help. Good support saves you time and stress.

---

### Criteria #8: Mobile Experience (5% of score)

**What we check:**
- Does crash work on mobile?
- Is it smooth or laggy?
- Auto-cashout reliable on mobile?
- Mobile-optimized site?

**How we test:**
1. We play crash on iPhone (iOS)
2. We play crash on Android
3. We note lag, crashes, UI issues

**Red flags:**
- Crash game crashes on mobile
- Lag makes auto-cashout fail
- Site not mobile-optimized (desktop-only)

**Why it matters (5% weight):**

70% of players gamble on mobile. If crash doesn't work on your phone, the casino is useless.

---

### Criteria #9: Responsible Gambling Tools (5% of score)

**What we check:**
- Deposit limits?
- Loss limits?
- Time-outs / self-exclusion?
- Reality checks?
- Links to GamCare, Gamblers Anonymous?

**How we test:**
1. We try to set deposit limits
2. We check for self-exclusion options
3. We verify RG links are working

**Red flags:**
- No RG tools (just "gamble responsibly" text)
- Broken RG links
- No deposit/loss limits

**Why it matters (5% weight):**

Ethical casinos care about addiction. Scam casinos don't.

## Our Testing Process

We don't just read reviews — we test casinos ourselves. Here's our 8-step process:

### Step 1: Sign-up

We create real accounts using VPNs (to test geo-restrictions). We note sign-up speed, KYC requirements, and welcome bonus flow.

### Step 2: Deposit

We deposit $50-200 of our own money (crypto usually). We test deposit speed, fees, and deposit limits.

### Step 3: Play

We play 100+ crash rounds. We test:
- Auto-cashout reliability
- Lag
- Mobile performance
- Game variety

### Step 4: Withdrawal Test

We request a withdrawal (even if we're down). We time how long it takes:
- Casino processing time
- Blockchain confirmation time
- Total time from request to funds in wallet

### Step 5: Support Test

We ask 5 questions via live chat. We time responses and rate quality.

### Step 6: Provably Fair Test

We verify crash game fairness:
1. Copy seed data from 10 bets
2. Run verification using casino's tool
3. Run 1,000 simulated rounds
4. Calculate actual RTP (should be 96-98%)

### Step 7: Review Research

We read 100+ external reviews:
- Trustpilot
- Reddit
- AskGamblers
- Casino forums

We look for patterns (unpaid withdrawals, rigged games, support issues).

### Step 8: Score Calculation

We rate on all 9 criteria, calculate weighted score, and decide:

**8.0+:** Recommended (top-tier)
**7.0-7.9:** Good (decent option)
**6.0-6.9:** Average (playable, but better exist)
**Below 6.0:** Not recommended

## Affiliate Disclosure: We Earn Commissions

**Yes, we earn money when you sign up.**

Here's exactly how much:

- **Standard commission:** 20-40% of your losses (revenue share)
- **CPA (one-time):** $50-200 per depositing player (some casinos)
- **Hybrid:** Revenue share + CPA

**Example:**
- You deposit $100 via our link
- You lose $50 (house edge)
- We earn 30% of your $50 loss = $15

**Why this matters:**

We have incentive to recommend casinos. High-paying casinos are tempting.

**How we stay honest:**

1. **We don't recommend casinos we haven't tested** — Every casino we list, we've played ourselves
2. **We blacklist bad casinos** — We've rejected casinos offering 50% commission because they failed our tests
3. **We update reviews** — If a casino goes bad (unpaid withdrawals, rigged games), we update or remove the review
4. **Our criteria are transparent** — You can see exactly HOW we rate (you're reading it)

**The bottom line:**

Affiliate commission ≠ biased reviews. We blacklist bad casinos even when they pay high commissions. Honesty builds trust; quick commissions kill it.

## Comparison: Our Ratings vs Competitors

| Aspect | Most Affiliate Sites | Our Ratings |
|--------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Criteria** | 3 shallow metrics (bonuses, games, "trust") | 9 crash-specific criteria |
| **Transparency** | "We're #1!" without proof | Full criteria disclosure (this page) |
| **Testing** | No real testing (just reading reviews) | We deposit, play, withdraw ourselves |
| **Blacklisting** | Rare (lose affiliate money) | Yes (we blacklisted 5 casinos in 2024) |
| **Affiliate disclosure** | Hidden or vague | Full transparency (this section) |

**Why our ratings are better:**

Most affiliate sites are shills. They promote whoever pays the most, ignore scams, and hide their commission structure.

We're different. We rate on crash-specific criteria, test casinos ourselves, and blacklist scammers even when they offer high commissions.
