# How to Verify Crash Game Fairness: Step-by-Step Guides for Popular Casinos

**Introduction**

"Provably fair" means nothing if you can't actually verify it.

Casinos claim their crash games are fair — multipliers are random, house edge is 3%, you have a legitimate shot at winning. But without verification, "provably fair" is just marketing fluff.

This guide teaches you how to verify crash game fairness yourself. We provide step-by-step instructions for Stake, BC.Game, Roobet, Thunderpick, and Metaspins. You'll learn how provably fair works, how to spot fake provably fair, and which casinos are actually transparent.

**We've tested these casinos ourselves.** Here's what we found.

## How Provably Fair Works

### The Concept

Provably fair is a cryptographic system that proves the casino couldn't have rigged the crash outcome after you placed your bet.

**How it works:**
1. **Before you bet:** Casino generates a random server seed and shares a HASH (encrypted version) with you
2. **You place your bet:** You provide or approve a client seed (your random input)
3. **Crash happens:** Server seed + client seed + nonce (round number) = crash point
4. **After the round:** Casino reveals the actual server seed (you can verify it matches the hash from step 1)
5. **You verify:** You can recreate the crash point yourself using the seeds — if it matches, game is fair

**Why it's trustworthy:**
- Casino commits to outcome BEFORE you bet (hash commitment)
- They can't change server seed after you bet (hash won't match)
- You contribute randomness (client seed)
- You can independently verify the math

### What to Look For (Transparent vs Opaque)

**Transparent Casinos (Good Signs):**
- ✅ Server seed hash is displayed BEFORE you bet
- ✅ Client seed is generated by YOU (not casino)
- ✅ Verification tool is built-in (one-click verify)
- ✅ You can run 1,000+ simulations to verify RTP
- ✅ Support can explain provably fair in detail

**Opaque Casinos (Red Flags):**
- ❌ No hash disclosure (they can change outcome after you bet)
- ❌ Client seed is generated by casino (they know result in advance)
- ❌ No verification tool (you have to "trust" them)
- ❌ Support can't explain provably fair (they don't understand it)
- ❌ Vague "we're fair" claims without proof

## What to Look For: Transparent vs Opaque Casinos

### Transparent Casinos (Good Signs)

**Hash Disclosure Before Bet:**
- Casino shows server seed hash BEFORE you place your bet
- This proves they can't change the seed after you bet
- Example: Stake shows current hash in real-time

**Client Seed Generated by YOU:**
- You create or approve the client seed (your random input)
- Casino can't predict your input
- Example: BC.Game lets you set your own client seed

**Built-In Verification Tool:**
- One-click verify (no external scripts needed)
- Clear instructions
- Example: Stake, BC.Game

**Simulation Capability:**
- You can run 1,000+ rounds to verify RTP
- Should be 96-97% for crash games
- Example: Stake's bulk verification tool

**Support Understands Provably Fair:**
- Agents can explain how it works
- They can walk you through verification
- Example: Thunderpick support is knowledgeable

### Opaque Casinos (Red Flags)

**No Hash Disclosure:**
- Casino only shows server seed AFTER the round
- They could change the seed after you bet
- This is NOT provably fair — it's "trust me" fair

**Client Seed Generated by Casino:**
- Casino creates client seed for you
- They know both seeds before you bet
- They can predict outcomes

**No Verification Tool:**
- Casino claims "provably fair" but provides no way to verify
- You have to "trust" them
- This is marketing fluff, not actual fairness

**Vague Claims:**
- "We're fair" without explaining HOW
- Support can't explain provably fair
- No documentation on fairness system

## Fake Provably Fair: How Casinos Cheat

### Scam #1: Hash is Fake

**How it works:**
- Casino displays a hash
- But that hash isn't actually used in the game
- Real game uses a different (rigged) seed

**Detection:**
- Verify crash point — if calculated result ≠ actual result, hash is fake
- Run 1,000 rounds — if RTP is 85-90%, provably fair is fake

**Real example (2024):**
A casino showed server seed hashes but didn't actually use them in game logic. Player verification revealed calculated crash points never matched actual results. The casino was faking transparency while rigging outcomes.

### Scam #2: Client Seed is Predictable

**How it works:**
- Casino generates client seed for you
- Seed looks random but follows a pattern
- Casino knows your seed in advance → knows crash point

**Detection:**
- If client seed is generated by casino (not you), it's a red flag
- Test: Create your own random seed — if casino won't accept it, they're cheating

### Scam #3: Verification Tool is Rigged

**How it works:**
- Verification tool ALWAYS shows "verified"
- Even if you input garbage data, it says "verified"
- Tool is a prop, not actual verification

**Detection:**
- Test verification tool with fake data
- If it still says "verified" regardless of input, tool is rigged
- Example: Input "AAAA" as server seed — should produce error, not "verified"

## Verification Tools & Calculators

### Built-In Tools (Best)

**Stake:** One-click verify, bulk verification for 1,000+ rounds
**BC.Game:** Live seed disclosure, easy verify tool
**Thunderpick:** Straightforward verification interface

### Third-Party Calculators

Some sites offer external verification scripts:
- **Provably Fair Verifier** (web-based tool)
- **Crash Game Calculator** (GitHub open-source scripts)

**Caution:** Only use reputable third-party tools. Some "verification" sites are phishing attempts.

### Write Your Own Script (Advanced)

If you're tech-savvy:

```javascript
// Simple crash verification script (example)
function verifyCrash(serverSeed, clientSeed, nonce) {
  const combined = serverSeed + clientSeed + nonce;
  const hash = sha256(combined);
  const crashPoint = deriveCrashPoint(hash);
  return crashPoint;
}
```

Use this to verify any casino that discloses seed data.

## FAQ

### Q: How do I verify crash game fairness?

**A:** 5-step process:
1. **Find a bet** in your bet history
2. **Copy seed data** (server seed, client seed, nonce)
3. **Use verification tool** (built-in or script)
4. **Calculate crash point** from seed data
5. **Compare to actual crash point** — if matches, game is fair

**Easiest method:** Use casino's built-in verification tool (Stake, BC.Game, Thunderpick all have one-click verify).

### Q: Can crash games be rigged even if they're "provably fair"?

**A:** YES. Scammers fake provably fair in 3 ways:
1. **Fake hash** (display hash but don't use it in game)
2. **Predictable client seed** (casino generates your seed, knows outcome)
3. **Rigged verification tool** (always shows "verified" regardless of input)

**How to detect:** Run 1,000 rounds, calculate actual RTP. If it's 85-90%, provably fair is fake. Legit crash games pay 96-97% RTP.

### Q: What if verification fails?

**A:** Immediate steps:
1. **Screenshot** the failed verification (show calculated vs actual result)
2. **Contact support** with evidence
3. **Don't deposit more** until resolved
4. **Share findings** on Reddit/Trustpilot (warn others)

**If casino ghosts you or bans you:** Blacklist them and warn others. Failed verification = rigged game.

### Q: Do all crash casinos have provably fair?

**A:** NO. Many licensed casinos (UKGC, MGA) use third-party testing instead:
- **eCOGRA** (independent auditor)
- **iTech Labs** (game certification)
- **GLI** (Gaming Laboratories International)

These are ALSO trustworthy — auditors verify game fairness. Provably fair is just one method (common in crypto casinos).

**If casino has NEITHER provably fair NOR third-party audit:** Avoid.

### Q: How do I know if provably fair is real?

**A:** 5 tests:
1. **Hash disclosure before bet** (not after)
2. **Client seed generated by YOU** (not casino)
3. **Verification tool works** (try with fake data — should error)
4. **RTP is 96-97%** when you simulate 1,000 rounds
5. **Support explains it clearly** (not vague "we're fair")

**If all 5 pass:** Provably fair is real.

### Q: Can I verify crash games on mobile?

**A:** YES. Most casinos offer mobile verification:
- **Stake:** Mobile-optimized verification tool
- **BC.Game:** Fairness page works on mobile
- **Thunderpick:** Mobile-friendly verify interface

**Process is same:** Copy seed data, use verification tool, compare results. Slightly more tedious on mobile (typing long strings), but fully functional.
