# How We Rate Crash Casinos: Full Transparency on Our Review Process

## Introduction: Why Transparency Matters

**Most affiliate sites won't tell you this:** We earn money when you sign up. Here's how we keep our ratings honest.

Affiliate sites have a financial incentive to promote casinos — if you sign up and lose, we earn a commission (20-40% of your losses). This creates a conflict of interest: **Why would we ever warn you away from a casino that pays us?**

Here's why: **Blacklisted casinos don't pay us.** If we recommend a scam casino, you'll lose money, never trust us again, and we'll lose our reputation. Long-term, honesty is more profitable than shilling.

This guide explains **exactly how we rate crash casinos** — our criteria, our testing process, our affiliate disclosure, and the casinos we've blacklisted.

**Our promise:** We only recommend casinos we'd play at ourselves.

---

## Our Rating Criteria (Crash-Specific)

We evaluate **9 crash-specific criteria**. Most affiliate sites use 3-4 shallow criteria (bonuses, games, "trust"). We go deeper.

---

### Criteria #1: Provably Fair Verification (20% of score)

**What we check:**
- Can we verify the crash game ourselves?
- Is server seed hashed and disclosed *before* we bet?
- Is client seed user-generated (not casino-generated)?
- Does the verification tool work?

**How we test:**
1. We place 20-30 small bets
2. Copy server seed, client seed, nonce
3. Use casino's verification tool
4. Confirm results match actual crash points
5. Run 1,000+ rounds to calculate actual RTP

**Red flags:**
- No hash disclosure (casino can change outcome after you bet)
- Client seed generated by casino (they can rig it)
- No verification tool (you have to "trust" them)
- Actual RTP is 85-90% (not 97%) = rigged

**Why it matters:**
If the game is rigged, nothing else matters. Fair games are the foundation of everything.

**Score:**
- ✅ Verified fair (97% RTP): 20/20 points
- ⚠️ Can verify but RTP is 95-96%: 10/20 points
- ❌ Can't verify or rigged: 0/20 points (automatic blacklist)

---

### Criteria #2: Licensing & Regulation (15% of score)

**What we check:**
- Curacao, MGA, UKGC (or no license)
- Is the license valid (check regulator's website)?
- Is the license expired/fake?

**How we verify:**
1. Find license number on casino site
2. Go to regulator's official website (Curacao eGaming, MGA, UKGC)
3. Search license number
4. Confirm it's active and legitimate

**Red flags:**
- No license displayed
- Fake license (we check on regulator's site)
- Expired license

**Why it matters:**
Licensed casinos have oversight (not guaranteed protection, but better than unlicensed). Regulators can revoke licenses, mediate disputes, and enforce rules.

**Score:**
- ✅ MGA/UKGC license: 15/15 points (strictest regulators)
- ✅ Curacao license: 12/15 points (weaker but legitimate)
- ❌ No license: 0/15 points (blacklist unless provably fair + track record)

---

### Criteria #3: Crash Game Variety (10% of score)

**What we check:**
- Aviator, Crash X, SpaceXY, multi-player crash
- How many crash games do they offer?
- Are they unique or cloned?

**How we test:**
1. We count all crash games on the site
2. Play each game for 10-20 rounds
3. Note variety (classic crash, themed crash, multiplayer)

**Red flags:**
- Only 1 crash game (boring, but not a dealbreaker)
- Cloned games (fake Aviator, copycat designs)

**Why it matters:**
Variety keeps gameplay fresh. One crash game gets monotonous. But this is a minor criterion — fair games matter more than variety.

**Score:**
- ✅ 5+ crash games: 10/10 points
- ✅ 3-4 crash games: 8/10 points
- ✅ 1-2 crash games: 5/10 points
- ❌ No crash games: 0/10 points (why are we reviewing them?)

---

### Criteria #4: Withdrawal Speed & Reliability (15% of score)

**What we check:**
- How fast do they pay?
- Do they actually pay?
- Are there withdrawal limits?

**How we test:**
1. We deposit $50-200 of our own money
2. Play 50-100 rounds
3. Request withdrawal
4. Time how long it takes (casino processing + blockchain)
5. Repeat 3-5 times to verify consistency

**Red flags:**
- Withdrawal takes 7+ days
- Withdrawal refused ("bonus abuse," "irregular play")
- Withdrawal limits under $1,000/day (not whale-friendly)
- "Unlimited withdrawals" (scam — they'll never pay big wins)

**Why it matters:**
Fast withdrawals = trustworthy casino. If they pay quickly, they're confident in their finances. If they delay, they're probably struggling.

**Score:**
- ✅ Instant-24 hours: 15/15 points (excellent)
- ✅ 24-48 hours: 12/15 points (good)
- ⚠️ 48-72 hours: 8/15 points (acceptable but slow)
- ❌ 7+ days or refused: 0/15 points (blacklist)

---

### Criteria #5: Bonuses (Fair Wagering) (10% of score)

**What we check:**
- Welcome bonus amount
- Wagering requirements
- Effective value (bonus ÷ wagering)

**How we test:**
1. Read bonus terms carefully
2. Calculate: (Bonus + Deposit) × Wagering = Amount you must bet
3. Assess if wagering is fair (30-40x is standard; 50x+ is predatory)

**Red flags:**
- 100x wagering (you'll never clear it)
- "Unlimited" bonus (scam)
- No bonus terms displayed (or terms are vague)
- 500% deposit match (too good to be true)

**Why it matters:**
Good bonuses = extra play (if wagering is fair). Bad bonuses = trap (you'll never withdraw).

**Score:**
- ✅ 100-200% bonus, 30-40x wagering: 10/10 points (fair)
- ✅ 200-300% bonus, 40x wagering: 8/10 points (good)
- ⚠️ 300%+ bonus, 50x wagering: 5/10 points (risky)
- ❌ 500%+ bonus, 100x wagering: 0/10 points (Ponzi scam)

---

### Criteria #6: User Reviews & Reputation (15% of score)

**What we check:**
- Trustpilot rating (4.0+ is good, 3.0-4.0 is mixed, below 3.0 is bad)
- Reddit threads (r/gambling, r/crashgambling)
- AskGamblers complaints

**How we test:**
1. Read 100+ Trustpilot reviews
2. Search "[casino name] scam" on Reddit
3. Check AskGamblers complaint section
4. Look for patterns (withdrawal refusals, rigged games)

**Red flags:**
- Multiple "scam" reviews
- 2-star Trustpilot rating (or worse)
- Reddit threads about stolen funds
- Unresolved AskGamblers complaints

**Why it matters:**
If players hate a casino, we won't recommend it. Reputation reflects actual user experience.

**Score:**
- ✅ 4.0-5.0 Trustpilot, positive Reddit: 15/15 points
- ✅ 3.5-4.0 Trustpilot, mixed reviews: 10/15 points
- ⚠️ 3.0-3.5 Trustpilot, some complaints: 5/15 points
- ❌ Below 3.0 Trustpilot, many scam reports: 0/15 points (blacklist)

---

### Criteria #7: Customer Support (5% of score)

**What we check:**
- Live chat, email, response time
- Support quality (knowledgeable vs bot-only)

**How we test:**
1. We ask 5 questions (provably fair, licensing, withdrawals, bonuses, responsible gambling)
2. Time how long it takes to respond
3. Assess if answers are accurate

**Red flags:**
- Bot-only support (can't answer real questions)
- 24+ hour response time
- Support can't explain provably fair (they don't understand it)

**Why it matters:**
If something goes wrong, you need help. Good support resolves issues fast.

**Score:**
- ✅ Live chat, <10 min response, knowledgeable: 5/5 points
- ✅ Email support, <24 hours, knowledgeable: 4/5 points
- ⚠️ Slow support, limited knowledge: 2/5 points
- ❌ Bot-only or unresponsive: 0/5 points

---

### Criteria #8: Mobile Experience (5% of score)

**What we check:**
- Does crash work on mobile?
- Is it smooth or laggy?

**How we test:**
1. Play crash on iPhone (Safari)
2. Play crash on Android (Chrome)
3. Note lag, crashes, UI issues

**Red flags:**
- Crash crashes on mobile (pun intended)
- Laggy gameplay
- Unusable UI on small screens

**Why it matters:**
70% of players gamble on mobile. If crash doesn't work on mobile, the casino is behind the times.

**Score:**
- ✅ Smooth mobile experience: 5/5 points
- ✅ Works but minor issues: 4/5 points
- ⚠️ Laggy but playable: 2/5 points
- ❌ Crashes or unusable: 0/5 points

---

### Criteria #9: Responsible Gambling Tools (5% of score)

**What we check:**
- Deposit limits, self-exclusion, time-outs
- Responsible gambling links (GamCare, Gamblers Anonymous)

**How we test:**
1. Try to set deposit limits
2. Check for self-exclusion options
3. Look for RG resources

**Red flags:**
- No RG tools
- "Gamble responsibly" lip service (no actual tools)

**Why it matters:**
Ethical casinos care about addiction. Scam casinos exploit it.

**Score:**
- ✅ Full RG tools (limits, self-exclusion, time-outs): 5/5 points
- ✅ Basic RG tools (deposit limits): 3/5 points
- ❌ No RG tools: 0/5 points

---

## Our Testing Process (Step-by-Step)

**We don't just look at a casino's website. We test it ourselves.**

### Step 1: Sign-up
We create real accounts using unique email addresses. We don't accept "review accounts" from casinos (too easy for them to rig).

### Step 2: Deposit
We deposit **$50-200 of our own money**. Real money, not bonus credits.

### Step 3: Play
We play **100+ rounds** across all crash games. We test variety, speed, gameplay.

### Step 4: Withdrawal Test
We request a withdrawal (small amount, $20-50). We time how long it takes.

### Step 5: Support Test
We ask 5 questions:
1. How does provably fair work?
2. What's your license number?
3. What are withdrawal limits?
4. What are bonus wagering requirements?
5. Do you offer responsible gambling tools?

We rate response time and accuracy.

### Step 6: Provably Fair Test
We verify 1,000+ rounds:
1. Place bets
2. Copy seed data
3. Use verification tool
4. Confirm results match
5. Calculate actual RTP

### Step 7: Review Research
We read 100+ external reviews:
- Trustpilot (overall rating + recent reviews)
- Reddit (search "[casino name] scam")
- AskGamblers (complaints section)

### Step 8: Score Calculation
We rate on all 9 criteria (total 100 points). Final score determines ranking.

### Step 9: Final Decision
- **8.0-10.0:** Recommend (top-tier)
- **7.0-7.9:** Good (decent option)
- **6.0-6.9:** Average (playable, but better options exist)
- **5.0-5.9:** Below average (not recommended)
- **Below 5.0:** Blacklist (avoid)

## Affiliate Disclosure: We Earn Commissions

**Yes, we earn money when you sign up.**

**How much:** 20-40% of your losses (industry standard). If you lose $1,000, we earn $200-400.

**Why it matters:**
We have a financial incentive to recommend casinos. Shady affiliate sites promote scams because they pay high commissions. We don't.

**How we stay honest:**
- We don't recommend casinos we haven't tested (all our reviews are based on firsthand testing)
- We blacklist casinos that fail our tests (we've blacklisted 7 casinos in 2024-2025)
- We update reviews if casinos go bad (we regularly re-test)
- Our rating criteria are transparent (you can see exactly how we rate)

**The bottom line:**
Affiliate commission ≠ biased reviews. We blacklist bad casinos because long-term reputation is worth more than short-term commissions.

**If we recommend a casino, we'd play there ourselves.**
