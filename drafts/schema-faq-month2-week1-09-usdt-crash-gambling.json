        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, for most players. USDT is stable ($1 value), so your bankroll doesn't fluctuate with crypto prices. Bitcoin is better for large deposits ($10,000+) due to wider acceptance."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "USDT20 (ERC-20) runs on Ethereum (fees: $1-$10). USDT TRC-20 runs on Tron (fees: $1 flat). TRC-20 is cheaper but has fewer casinos supporting it."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, if you play at licensed, provably fair casinos. USDT itself is safe (fully backed by reserves). Avoid unlicensed casinos."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Highly unlikely. USDT is fully backed by reserves and has maintained its $1 peg since 2014. Even during market crashes, USDT stays stable."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Both work well. USDT is more widely accepted at crash casinos. USDC is slightly more transparent (monthly reserves audits) but fewer casinos support it."
