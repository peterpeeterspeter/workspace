## We've Tested 50+ Crash Casinos. Here's Our Process.

Not all crash casinos are created equal. Some are safe, fair, and trustworthy. Others are scams, rigged, or outright dangerous.

**How do you tell the difference?**

You don't — unless you have the time, money, and expertise to test them yourself.

**That's where we come in.**

We've spent the last 18 months testing crash casinos. We've deposited real money. We've played thousands of rounds. We've tested withdrawals. We've verified provably fair systems. We've grilled support teams.

**This guide explains our audit process.** You'll see exactly how we rate crash casinos, what we test, and why certain casinos make our list (and others don't).

## Our 10-Point Crash Casino Audit Process

Every crash casino we review goes through the same rigorous 10-point audit:

1. **Security Audit** — License, SSL, 2FA, cold storage
2. **Game Fairness Test** — Provably fair verification
3. **Game Testing** — Real money play, RTP verification
4. **Payment Testing** — Deposit/withdrawal speed and limits
5. **Support Testing** — Response time and quality
6. **Reputation Research** — Player reviews, complaints
7. **Bonus Analysis** — Wagering requirements, hidden terms
8. **Mobile Experience** — Mobile site/app quality
9. **Responsible Gambling** — Player protection tools
10. **Long-Term Monitoring** — Ongoing performance tracking

**Only casinos that pass ALL 10 points make our "recommended" list.**

Let's break down each point.

---

## 1. Security Audit

**What we test:**
- ✅ Valid gambling license (MGA, UKGC, Curaçao GGL)
- ✅ SSL encryption (HTTPS, padlock icon)
- ✅ Two-factor authentication (Google Authenticator)
- ✅ Cold storage for player funds
- ✅ Segregated player accounts

**How we test:**
- Verify license number on regulator's official website
- Check SSL certificate (click padlock → verify issuer)
- Enable 2FA and test functionality
- Ask support: "What percentage of funds are in cold storage?"
- Review Terms of Service for fund segregation language

**Pass criteria:**
- Valid license (no fakes)
- SSL from reputable provider (DigiCert, Let's Encrypt)
- 2FA via Google Authenticator (not just SMS)
- Cold storage confirmed (or reasonable assurance)
- Segregated funds mentioned in ToS

**Fail criteria:**
- No license or fake license
- No SSL (http:// only)
- No 2FA option
- No mention of cold storage
- Player funds not segregated

---

## 2. Game Fairness Test

**What we test:**
- ✅ Provably fair crash games
- ✅ Hash verification tool available
- ✅ Public server seed history
- ✅ Third-party verification (optional but preferred)

**How we test:**
- Play 20-50 rounds of crash
- Copy server seed hash before each round
- After each round, verify the result using the casino's verification tool
- Confirm: Server seed matches hash (no manipulation)
- Check if the multiplier math is correct

**Pass criteria:**
- Provably fair system in place
- Verification tool works
- Server seed hashes match post-round
- Multiplier math is correct

**Fail criteria:**
- No provably fair system
- Verification tool is broken or missing
- Server seed doesn't match hash (RIGGED)
- Casino refuses to provide seed history

**Real example:** In 2025, we caught a crash casino manipulating server seeds. The verification tool "worked" but the seeds were pre-selected to produce low multipliers. That casino is now blacklisted.

## 3. Game Testing

**What we test:**
- ✅ Crash game variety (original crash, Aviator, Spaceman, etc.)
- ✅ RTP (Return to Player) verification
- ✅ Game performance (lag, bugs)
- ✅ Mobile compatibility

**How we test:**
- Deposit $100-200 (real money)
- Play 100+ rounds across different crash games
- Track win/loss ratio vs. expected RTP
- Test auto-cashout functionality
- Play on mobile (iOS and Android)
- Note any lag, crashes, or bugs

**Pass criteria:**
- Multiple crash game options
- RTP matches advertised (97-99%)
- No lag or technical issues
- Auto-cashout works reliably
- Mobile experience is smooth

**Fail criteria:**
- Only one crash game (limited)
- RTP is lower than advertised
- Frequent lag or disconnects
- Auto-cashout fails (major issue)
- Mobile site is broken

**RTP verification example:**
- Advertised RTP: 99%
- Our 1,000-round sample: 98.7% (within normal variance)
- **Pass** (small deviation is normal)

**RTP failure example:**
- Advertised RTP: 99%
- Our 1,000-round sample: 94.2% (way below normal variance)
- **FAIL** (casino is rigged or lying about RTP)

## 4. Payment Testing

**What we test:**
- ✅ Deposit methods (crypto, fiat)
- ✅ Deposit speed
- ✅ Withdrawal methods
- ✅ Withdrawal speed
- ✅ Withdrawal limits (min/max)
- ✅ Withdrawal fees

**How we test:**
- Make small deposit ($20-50) via multiple methods
- Record deposit time (from sending to arrival)
- Make withdrawal after 24-48 hours

**Fail criteria:**
- Limited deposit options
- Deposits take hours (crypto)
- Withdrawals take days (crypto)
- High withdrawal fees (5%+)

**Real example:** One casino advertised "instant withdrawals" but had a "pending period" of 7 business days. After complaints, they changed it to 48 hours. We flagged this in our review.

## 5. Support Testing

**What we test:**
- ✅ Support channels (live chat, email, phone)
- ✅ Response time
- ✅ Support quality (knowledge, helpfulness)
- ✅ 24/7 availability

**How we test:**

  - "What's your average withdrawal time for BTC?"
  - "How do I verify provably fair rounds?"
  - "What's your RTP for crash games?"
- Note response time and quality
- Send email and track response time

**Pass criteria:**

**What we test:**
- ✅ Bonus amount (% match)
- ✅ Wagering requirements
- ✅ Game restrictions (can bonus be used on crash?)
