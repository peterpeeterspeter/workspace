### 4. External Authority Links

**Add to "Step 1: Check the Casino License" section:**

**After "What licenses are legitimate" list, add:**

```markdown
**Verify licenses directly with regulators:**
- **[Malta Gaming Authority - License Search](https://www.mga.org.mt/licensing/)** — Search MGA license numbers
- **[Curacao eGaming - Licensees](https://curacao-egaming.com/licensees/)** — Browse Curacao license holders
- **[UK Gambling Commission - License Register](https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/register-search)** — Verify UKGC licenses
```

**Add to "What to Do If You Get Scammed" section:**

**In the documentation step, add:**

```markdown
**Archive terms before they disappear:**
- **[Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/)** — Save cached versions of casino pages
- **[Archive.today](https://archive.today/)** — Quick page snapshots with timestamps

This prevents casinos from changing terms after you deposit.
```

**Add new resource section at the end:**

```markdown
**External Safety Resources:**
- **[GamCare - Stay Safe](https://www.gamcare.org.uk/get-advice/staying-safe/)** — Gambling safety guidelines
- **[Begambleaware - Choosing a Casino](https://www.begambleaware.org/)** — What to look for in licensed operators
- **[AskGamblers - Safety First](https://www.askgamblers.com/safety/)** — Casino safety tips
```
