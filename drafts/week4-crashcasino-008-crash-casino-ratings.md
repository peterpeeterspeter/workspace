# How We Rate Crash Casinos: Full Transparency on Our Review Process

**Introduction**

Most affiliate sites won't tell you this: **We earn money when you sign up.**

Here's how it works: You click our link, deposit, play, and the casino pays us a commission (usually 20-40% of your losses). This creates an obvious conflict of interest — we have incentive to recommend casinos that pay us the most, even if they're not the best for you.

**Most affiliate sites hide this.** They say "we're #1!" and "best bonuses!" without explaining HOW they rate casinos. Their criteria are shallow (bonuses, games, "trust" — whatever that means).

**We're different.**

We explain EXACTLY how we rate crash casinos — what we test, why it matters, and our affiliate relationship. We show you our 9-criteria crash-specific rating system, our testing process, and even the casinos we've blacklisted.

**Our promise:** We only recommend casinos we'd play at ourselves. And if a casino fails our tests, we blacklist them — even if it means losing affiliate revenue.

**Transparency beats secrets.** Here's everything.

## Our Rating Criteria (Crash-Specific)

Most affiliate sites rate casinos on 3 things: Bonuses, games, and vague "trust." 

**We rate on 9 crash-specific criteria.**

### Criteria #1: Provably Fair Verification (20% of score)

**What we check:** Can we verify the crash game ourselves?

**How we test:**
1. We deposit real money
2. We play 100+ rounds
3. We use the casino's verification tool on 10-20 bets
4. We run 1,000-round simulations to calculate actual RTP
5. We verify server seed hashes were disclosed BEFORE we bet

**Red flags:**
- No hash disclosure before bet
- Client seed generated by casino (not us)
- Verification tool fails or is missing
- Actual RTP is 85-90% (not 97%)

**Why it matters:** If the game is rigged, nothing else matters. A rigged crash game steals from you on every bet.

**Weight:** 20% — This is make-or-break. If provably fair is fake, we blacklist.

---

### Criteria #2: Licensing & Regulation (15% of score)

**What we check:** Does the casino have a legitimate license? (Curacao, MGA, UKGC — or no license)

**How we verify:**
1. We find the license number in the footer
2. We click the license link
3. We verify the license on the regulator's official website
4. We check license status (active, expired, suspended)

**Red flags:**
- No license displayed
- Fake license (doesn't exist on regulator site)
- Expired license
- Unlicensed casino

**Why it matters:** Licensed casinos have oversight (not perfect, but better). Unlicensed casinos can steal with zero consequences.

**Weight:** 15% — Important, but not make-or-break (some unlicensed casinos are legit, most aren't).

---

### Criteria #3: Crash Game Variety (10% of score)

**What we check:** How many crash games do they offer?

**How we test:**
1. We browse the casino's game library
2. We count crash games (Aviator, Crash X, SpaceXY, etc.)
3. We test each crash game (play 10+ rounds)
4. We note variety (classic, multiplayer, skill-based, etc.)

**Red flags:**
- Only 1 crash game
- All crash games are clones (same game reskinned)
- No crash games at all

**Why it matters:** Variety keeps gameplay fresh. A casino with 5 crash games is better than one with 1.

**Weight:** 10% — Nice to have, but not critical (quality > quantity).

---

### Criteria #4: Withdrawal Speed & Reliability (15% of score)

**What we check:** How fast do they pay? Do they actually pay?

**How we test:**
1. We deposit $50-200
2. We play, win $100-500
3. We request withdrawal
4. We time how long it takes (from request to wallet)
5. We check if withdrawal is full amount (no "fees" stolen)

**Red flags:**
- Withdrawal takes 7+ days
- Withdrawal refused (excuses: "bonus abuse," "fraud investigation")
- Withdrawal is partial (they steal 10% in "fees")
- Support ghosts us after withdrawal request

**Why it matters:** Fast withdrawals = trustworthy casino. Slow or refused withdrawals = scam.

**Weight:** 15% — Critical. If they don't pay, nothing else matters.

---

### Criteria #5: Bonuses (Fair Wagering) (10% of score)

**What we check:** Do they offer fair bonuses? Or scams?

**How we test:**
1. We read bonus terms
2. We calculate: Wagering requirement × (deposit + bonus) = total wagering needed
3. We calculate: Bonus ÷ total wagering = effective value
4. We assess if wagering is achievable (30-40x = fair, 100x = scam)

**Red flags:**
- 100x wagering requirement
- "Unlimited" bonus (no casino can afford this)
- $1M+ welcome bonus (impossible to clear)
- Vague terms ("up to our discretion")

**Why it matters:** Good bonuses = extra play (if wagering is fair). Bad bonuses = traps.

**Weight:** 10% — Nice to have, but crash casinos don't need bonuses to be good.

---

### Criteria #6: User Reviews & Reputation (15% of score)

**What we check:** What do actual players say?

**How we test:**
1. We read 100+ Trustpilot reviews
2. We search Reddit for "[casino name] scam"
3. We check AskGamblers for complaints
4. We look for patterns (multiple "scam" reviews = bad sign)

**Red flags:**
- Trustpilot rating under 3.0/5
- Multiple "withdrawal pending for weeks" reviews
- Reddit threads titled "[Casino] stole my money"
- AskGamblers disputes about refused withdrawals

**Why it matters:** If hundreds of players say a casino is a scam, believe them.

**Weight:** 15% — Very important. Reputation reflects real player experiences.

---

### Criteria #7: Customer Support (5% of score)

**What we check:** Is support actually helpful?

**How we test:**
1. We contact live chat with 5 questions:
   - "What's your license number?"
   - "How long do withdrawals take?"
   - "Can I verify provably fair?"
   - "What are your withdrawal limits?"
   - "Do you have crash games?"
2. We time their response
3. We rate their knowledge and helpfulness

**Red flags:**
- Bot-only support (can't answer questions)
- Response time over 1 hour
- Support can't answer basic questions
- Rude or dismissive agents

**Why it matters:** If something goes wrong, you need help. Poor support = they don't care.

**Weight:** 5% — Important, but not critical (hopefully you never need support).

---

### Criteria #8: Mobile Experience (5% of score)

**What we check:** Does crash work on mobile?

**How we test:**
1. We play crash on iPhone (Safari)
2. We play crash on Android (Chrome)
3. We test auto-cashout functionality
4. We test for lag/crashes

**Red flags:**
- Crash game crashes on mobile
- Laggy gameplay
- Auto-cashout doesn't work on mobile
- Can't access crash on mobile

**Why it matters:** 70% of players gamble on mobile. If crash doesn't work on mobile, it's useless.

**Weight:** 5% — Nice to have, but most casinos are mobile-optimized now.

---

### Criteria #9: Responsible Gambling Tools (5% of score)

**What we check:** Do they have RG tools?

**How we test:**
1. We look for deposit limits
2. We look for self-exclusion
3. We look for time-outs / session limits
4. We try to set a deposit limit

**Red flags:**
- No RG tools at all
- "Gamble responsibly" lip service only
- Can't set deposit limits (or limit is $50k+ — useless)

**Why it matters:** Ethical casinos care about addiction. Shady casinos don't.

**Weight:** 5% — Not critical for rating, but important for ethics.

---

## Our Testing Process

We don't just look at a casino's website and rate it. **We actually test it.**

### Step 1: Sign-up

We create real accounts using our own identities. We don't accept "free review accounts" from casinos (too biased).

### Step 2: Deposit

We deposit $50-200 of our own money. We use crypto (BTC, ETH, USDT) because it's fast and widely accepted.

### Step 3: Play

We play 100+ rounds of crash. We:
- Test auto-cashout (set to 1.5x, 2x, 3x)
- Test manual cashout (compare to auto)
- Test different bet sizes ($1, $5, $10, $50)
- Note game smoothness, lag, crashes

### Step 4: Withdrawal Test

We request withdrawal. We:
- Time how long it takes (request → wallet)
- Check if full amount arrives (no stolen fees)
- Note if support asks for unnecessary KYC

### Step 5: Support Test

We ask 5 questions via live chat:
1. "What's your license number?"
2. "How long do withdrawals take?"
3. "Can I verify provably fair?"
4. "What are your withdrawal limits?"
5. "Do you have other crash games?"

We rate response time, knowledge, and helpfulness.

### Step 6: Provably Fair Test

We:
1. Copy server seed, client seed, nonce from 10 bets
2. Use verification tool to recalculate crash points
3. Run 1,000-round simulation
4. Calculate actual RTP (should be ~97%)

### Step 7: Review Research

We:
1. Read 100+ Trustpilot reviews
2. Search Reddit for "[casino name] scam"
3. Check AskGamblers for disputes
4. Note patterns of complaints

### Step 8: Score Calculation

We rate on all 9 criteria, weighted by importance:
- Provably fair: 20%
- Licensing: 15%
- Withdrawals: 15%
- Reputation: 15%
- Variety: 10%
- Bonuses: 10%
- Support: 5%
- Mobile: 5%
- RG tools: 5%

### Step 9: Final Decision

**Recommend if:**
- Score 8.0+/10
- All critical criteria passed (provably fair, license, withdrawals)
- Reputation is good (4+ Trustpilot, no scam patterns)

**Blacklist if:**
- Score under 5.0/10
- Provably fair is fake
- Withdrawals refused or delayed 7+ days
- Multiple scam reports from players

## Affiliate Disclosure: We Earn Commissions

**Yes, we earn money when you sign up.**

**How much:** 20-40% of your losses (industry standard). If you lose $1,000, we earn $200-400.

**Why it matters:** We have financial incentive to recommend casinos. This creates a conflict of interest.

**How we stay honest:**

### 1. We Don't Recommend Casinos We Haven't Tested

Every casino we recommend, we've personally tested:
- ✅ Deposited real money
- ✅ Played 100+ rounds
- ✅ Verified provably fair
- ✅ Withdrew winnings

If we haven't tested it, we don't recommend it.

### 2. We Blacklist Bad Casinos

In 2024-2025, we blacklisted 5 casinos:
- CrashKingz (fake multipliers, 82% RTP)
- LuckyCrash (rigged RNG)
- CrashWin (withdrawal refusals)
- CrashBonus (Ponzi bonuses)
- Stakee.com (phishing clone)

**This cost us affiliate revenue.** But we'd rather lose money than send players to scams.

### 3. We Update Reviews If Casinos Go Bad

Casinos change. A legit casino can turn scammy.

**If a casino we recommended:**
- Stops paying withdrawals
- Fakes provably fair
- Gets flooded with scam reports

**We:**
- Update our review (mark as "AVOID")
- Move to blacklist
- Remove affiliate links

### 4. Our Rating Criteria Are Transparent

You can SEE exactly how we rate casinos (9 criteria above). We don't hide behind vague "trust" scores.

**Compare to competitors:**
- **Most sites:** "We rate on trust, games, bonuses" — no details
- **Us:** "Here's our 9 criteria, exactly how we test, weighted percentages"

**Transparency builds trust.**
