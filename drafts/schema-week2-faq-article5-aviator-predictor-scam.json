        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes. Low-multiplier cashout (1.5x-2x), Fibonacci progression, and bankroll management (1-2% rule) are legitimate strategies. They don't beat the house edge, but they help you play smarter."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Low-multiplier cashout (1.5x-2x) + 1-2% bankroll management. High win probability, low variance, extends playtime. Not profitable long-term (-EV), but better than chasing losses."

        "text": "No — if you play at provably fair casinos (Stake, BC.Game, etc.). You can verify every round was generated fairly using the provably fair system. Rigged Aviator exists at shady casinos—avoid them."
