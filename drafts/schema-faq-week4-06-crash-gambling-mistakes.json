        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "You're probably making mistakes (no auto-cashout, chasing losses, betting too big). Or you're playing a rigged game (not provably fair). Fix mistakes, play provably fair casinos, accept -3% EV (house always wins)."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "YES. Always. Auto-cashout eliminates reaction time, removes emotion, guarantees you get your multiplier (or crash trying). Manual cashout = missed multipliers."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Never more than 5% of your bankroll (1-3% is safer). If you have $100, max bet is $5. This gives you 20+ chances to recover from losses."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "No. Crash has ~3% house edge. Long-term, you'll lose 3% of every bet. Short-term wins = variance (not skill). If you're profitable after 1,000+ rounds, then we can talk (but you won't be)."

        "text": "Chasing losses (mistake #3). It turns small losses into catastrophes. Lose $50 → Bet $100 to win it back → Lose → Down $150 → Bet $200 → Lose → Down $350. In 3 rounds, you turned a 5% loss into a 35% loss."
