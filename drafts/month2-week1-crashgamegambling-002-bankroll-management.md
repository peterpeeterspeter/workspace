## Quick Take

Crash gambling bankroll management isn't glamorous—but it's what separates players who last a week from players who last years. In this guide, you'll learn exactly how to size your bets, set loss limits, and manage variance so you can play crash games without going broke.

**The hard truth:** No crash strategy can overcome a -EV game. But proper bankroll management? That's what keeps you in the game long enough to hit a lucky streak.

---

## What Is Bankroll Management? (And Why It Matters)

Your **bankroll** is the total amount of money you've set aside for crash gambling. **Bankroll management** is the system of rules that determines:

- How much you bet per round
- When you stop for the day
- How you handle winning and losing streaks
- When to walk away—permanently

**Why it matters:**

Crash games have a **house edge of 1-4%**. That means for every $100 you bet, you'll lose $1-4 on average. Over thousands of rounds, that adds up. Without proper bankroll management, **variance will wipe you out** before you see any lucky streaks.

**The math reality:**

Even with a 99% RTP game:
- Betting 10% of your bankroll per round = **90% chance of going broke within 100 rounds**
- Betting 1% of your bankroll per round = **<5% chance of going broke within 1,000 rounds**

Small bet sizing = longer survival = more chances to get lucky.

---

## The Golden Rule: 1% Rule (Never Bet More Than You Can Afford to Lose)

The most important bankroll management rule:

**Never bet more than 1% of your total bankroll on a single crash round.**

**Example:**
- Total bankroll: $500
- Max bet per round: $5 (1% of $500)
- Even if you lose 10 rounds in a row, you've only lost 10% of your bankroll

**What happens if you bet more?**

| Bet Size | Rounds to Survive 10-Loss Streak | Risk of Ruin |
|----------|----------------------------------|--------------|
| 10% of bankroll | 10 rounds | ~90% |
| 5% of bankroll | 20 rounds | ~65% |
| 2% of bankroll | 50 rounds | ~25% |
| 1% of bankroll | 100 rounds | <10% |

**The crash reality:** Losing 10 rounds in a row happens. Losing 20 in a row happens. If you're betting 5-10% of your bankroll, a normal variance streak will wipe you out.

---

## Step 1: Determine Your Total Bankroll

Before you play, decide:

**"This is my crash gambling budget. If I lose it, I'm done."**

**Guidelines:**

- **Only gamble money you can afford to lose** (rent, bills, savings = off-limits)
- **Start small:** $100-500 is enough to learn (don't start with $5,000)
- **Separate your crash bankroll** from other gambling (slots, sports betting, poker)

**Example setup:**
- Monthly gambling budget: $1,000
- Crash gambling allocation: $300 (30%)
- **Your crash bankroll: $300** (fixed for the month)

**Pro tip:** If you can't afford to lose your bankroll, you're gambling with money you shouldn't be risking. That's how problems start.

---

## Step 2: Set Your Base Unit (Bet Size Per Round)

Your **base unit** is the amount you bet on a standard crash round.

**Formula:**
```
Base Unit = Total Bankroll × 1%
```

**Examples:**

| Bankroll | Base Unit (1%) | Conservative (0.5%) | Aggressive (2%) |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| $100 | $1 | $0.50 | $2 |
| $500 | $5 | $2.50 | $10 |
| $1,000 | $10 | $5 | $20 |
| $5,000 | $50 | $25 | $100 |

**Best practice:** Start at **0.5-1%** while learning. Only increase to 2% if you're consistently profitable (hint: almost no one is).

---

## Step 3: Set Your Daily Loss Limit

Before you start playing, decide:

**"If I lose $X today, I stop. No exceptions."**

**Guidelines:**

- **Daily loss limit: 10-20% of your total bankroll**
- **Weekly loss limit: 30-50% of your total bankroll**
- **Monthly loss limit: 100% of your total bankroll** (if you hit this, take a break)

**Example:**
- Total bankroll: $500
- Daily loss limit: $50 (10% of $500)
- Weekly loss limit: $150 (30% of $500)
- Monthly loss limit: $500 (100% = full reset)

**When you hit your limit:**

1. **Close the crash game immediately** (don't chase losses)
2. **Don't deposit more** (that's how problems escalate)
3. **Take a break** (24 hours minimum, preferably longer)
4. **Review what went wrong** (bet sizing? emotional play? bad luck?)

**Chasing losses = fastest way to bankruptcy.**

---

## Step 4: Set Your Win Goal (And Actually Walk Away)

Most crash gamblers set loss limits but **never set win goals**. That's why they lose everything back.

**Your win goal:** "If I win $X today, I cash out and stop."

**Guidelines:**

- **Daily win goal: 20-50% of your daily loss limit**
- **Weekly win goal: 50-100% of your weekly loss limit**
- **Monthly win goal: 100-200% of your monthly bankroll**

**Example:**
- Daily loss limit: $50
- Daily win goal: $25 (50% of loss limit)
- **Net result:** You risk $50 to make $25. That's bad odds—but crash gambling has worse odds.

**When you hit your win goal:**

1. **Withdraw your profits immediately** (don't leave them in your casino account)
2. **Close the crash game** (don't give it back)
3. **Celebrate the win** (you beat the house edge—this time)
4. **Come back tomorrow** (with fresh discipline)

**Pro tip:** The best crash gamblers treat winnings as **real money**, not house money. Every dollar you withdraw is a dollar the casino can't take back.

## Step 5: Handle Variance (Surviving Losing Streaks)

Variance in crash gambling is brutal. Here's how to survive it.

**What is variance?**

Variance is the natural swing between winning and losing streaks. Even with perfect strategy, you'll experience:

- **10-round losing streaks** (common)
- **20-round losing streaks** (happens weekly)
- **50-round losing streaks** (happens monthly if you play a lot)

**Your defense: Bet sizing.**

**The math:**

| Bet Size | Bankroll Needed for 50-Loss Streak |
|----------|-----------------------------------|
| 1% of bankroll | 50 rounds |
| 2% of bankroll | 50 rounds (but you're broke after 50 losses) |
| 5% of bankroll | 20 rounds (50-loss streak = bankruptcy) |

**The brutal reality:** If you're betting 5% per round, a 20-round losing streak (which happens regularly) will wipe you out. If you're betting 1%, you survive easily.

**Survival tips:**

- **Drop your bet size after 5 consecutive losses** (cut in half)
- **Take a break after 10 consecutive losses** (15 minutes minimum)
- **Never increase your bet to "win it back"** (that's chasing)
- **Accept variance as normal** (it's not rigged, it's math)

## Common Bankroll Management Mistakes (And How to Fix Them)

### Mistake #1: Betting More Than 1% Per Round

**The problem:** You bet 5-10% of your bankroll per round because "it's just a few bucks."

**The reality:** A 20-round losing streak (which happens) wipes you out.

**The fix:** Never bet more than 1%. Start at 0.5% if you're a beginner.

### Mistake #2: No Daily Loss Limit

**The problem:** You lose $100, then deposit $100 more, then lose that too.

**The reality:** You're chasing losses—and the house edge guarantees you'll lose long-term.

**The fix:** Set a 10-20% daily loss limit and **stop when you hit it**. No exceptions.

### Mistake #3: No Win Goal

**The problem:** You win $200, keep playing, and lose it all back.

**The reality:** The casino has an infinite bankroll. You don't. Playing until you lose is a guaranteed way to leave with nothing.

**The fix:** Set a 20-50% daily win goal and **withdraw when you hit it**.

### Mistake #4: Treating Winnings as "House Money"

**The problem:** "I'm playing with their money now, not mine."

**The reality:** Money in your casino account is **your money**. The casino doesn't care if you won it or deposited it.

**The fix:** Withdraw winnings immediately. Treat every dollar as real—because it is.

### Mistake #5: Re-Depositing After Hitting Your Loss Limit

**The problem:** You lose your daily limit, deposit more, and lose that too.

**The reality:** You're breaking your own rules. Once you break one rule, you'll break others.

**The fix:** If you hit your loss limit, you're done for the day. Close the casino.

## Bankroll Management by Bankroll Size

### Small Bankroll ($100-300)

**Challenges:** High variance risk, limited room for error

**Strategy:**
- **Bet size:** 0.5% of bankroll ($0.50-$1.50 per round)
- **Daily loss limit:** 10% ($10-$30)
- **Win goal:** 20% of loss limit ($2-$6)
- **Focus:** Survival, not profit. Small bankrolls are for learning.

### Medium Bankroll ($500-1,500)

**Challenges:** Managing emotions after big swings

**Strategy:**
- **Bet size:** 1% of bankroll ($5-$15 per round)
- **Daily loss limit:** 15% ($75-$225)
- **Win goal:** 30% of loss limit ($22-$67)
- **Focus:** Consistent play, gradual growth.

### Large Bankroll ($2,000+)

**Challenges:** Complacency, overconfidence

**Strategy:**
- **Bet size:** 0.5-1% of bankroll ($10-$20+ per round)
- **Daily loss limit:** 10% ($200+)
- **Win goal:** 25% of loss limit ($50+)
- **Focus:** Discipline. Large bankrolls magnify mistakes.

## Advanced: The Kelly Criterion (For Math Geeks)

The **Kelly Criterion** is a formula for optimal bet sizing based on your edge.

**Formula:**
```
Kelly % = (Edge / Odds) - Variance Adjustment
```

**The problem with crash games:**

Crash games have a **negative edge** (-1% to -4%). The Kelly Criterion for negative-edge games is:

**Bet $0. Don't play.**

**The reality:** Kelly only works if you have a **positive edge** (card counting, arbitrage, insider info). In crash gambling, you don't.

**What Kelly teaches us:** Even if you had a 1% edge (you don't), you'd only bet 0.5-1% of your bankroll. And with a -3% edge? The optimal bet is $0.

**Lesson:** If you're going to play anyway (we know you will), bet small. 1% max.

---

## Emotional Discipline: The Hardest Part

Bankroll management isn't a math problem. It's an **emotional discipline problem**.

**You'll feel:**
- **Invincible** after a win (tempted to increase bets)
- **Desperate** after a loss (tempted to chase)
- **Bored** after break-even play (tempted to gamble more)

**The rule:** Follow your system **regardless of emotions**.

- Won $100? Withdraw it.
- Lost $50? Stop for the day.
- Bored? Go do something else.

**The best crash gamblers aren't luckier.** They're more disciplined.

## Bankroll Management Checklist

Before every crash session, confirm:

- [ ] Total bankroll set (money you can afford to lose)
- [ ] Base unit calculated (1% of bankroll)
- [ ] Daily loss limit set (10-20% of bankroll)
- [ ] Daily win goal set (20-50% of loss limit)
- [ ] Withdrawal method ready (cash out wins immediately)
- [ ] Discipline mindset engaged (follow rules, no exceptions)

**If you can't check all 6 boxes, don't play.**

## The Uncomfortable Truth: You Will Lose Long-Term

Here's the reality no crash gambling guide wants to admit:

**No bankroll management system can overcome a -EV game.**

- Crash games have a 1-4% house edge
- That means you'll lose 1-4% of everything you bet over time
- Bankroll management only **slows** the loss—it doesn't reverse it

**So why play?**

- **Entertainment:** If you treat crash gambling as paid entertainment (like a movie ticket), you'll be fine
- **Fun:** Small stakes, low expectations, accept losses as the cost of fun
- **Hope:** You might get lucky—but don't count on it

**When to stop completely:**

- You've lost your full monthly bankroll
- You're chasing losses regularly
- You're betting more than 1% per round
- You're borrowing money to gamble
- You're hiding losses from friends/family

**If any of these apply, stop. Now.**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much should I start with?

**Start with $100-500 minimum.** Anything less and variance will wipe you out before you learn. Anything more and you're risking too much while learning.

### Can I make a living playing crash?

**No.** Crash games have a -1% to -4% house edge. You can't overcome that with strategy. Play for fun, not profit.

### What if I win big early?

**Withdraw immediately.** Don't increase your bet size. Don't "let it ride." Take the money and run.

### How often should I withdraw?

**Every time you hit your win goal.** If you win $25 in a session, withdraw it. Don't leave profits in your casino account.

### Is 1% betting too conservative?

**No, it's the only safe way.** Anything more and a normal losing streak will wipe you out. Crash gambling is a marathon, not a sprint.

### What if I lose my entire bankroll?

**Stop gambling.** Take a break (at least 30 days). Re-evaluate whether you can afford to lose more. If you can't, don't redeposit.

### Can I increase my bet size after a win?

**Only if you increase your bankroll.** If you turn $500 into $1,000, you can increase your base unit from $5 (1% of $500) to $10 (1% of $1,000). Never increase bet size just because you're "feeling lucky."
