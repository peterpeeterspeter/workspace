## How Bitcoin Crash Games Work

**The basics are the same as traditional crash games, but with Bitcoin as the currency:**

1. **Deposit BTC** → Send Bitcoin from your wallet to the casino
2. **Place bet** → Wager BTC (usually 0.0001-1 BTC)
3. **Multiplier climbs** → Watch the multiplier rise
4. **Cash out** → Win BTC × multiplier
5. **Withdraw BTC** → Receive winnings in your Bitcoin wallet

**Example:**
```
Bet: 0.001 BTC
Multiplier climbs: 1.00x → 1.50x → 2.00x → 2.50x
You cash out at 2.00x: Win 0.002 BTC

## Bitcoin vs Fiat for Crash Gambling

| Feature | Bitcoin | Fiat (USD/EUR) |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| **Deposit speed** | 10-60 min | Instant (card) or 1-5 days (bank) |
| **Withdrawal speed** | 0-6 hours | 3-7 business days |
| **Fees** | $0.50-5 | 2-5% ($20-50 per $1,000) |
| **Privacy** | High | Low (bank tracks transactions) |
| **Global access** | Yes | Often restricted |
| **Chargebacks** | No | Yes (but casinos ban you) |
| **Volatility** | High (BTC price changes) | Stable |

**Bottom line:** Bitcoin is faster, more private, and has lower fees. But you need to understand BTC price volatility.

---

## Managing Bitcoin Price Volatility

**The risk:** BTC price can swing 10-20% in a day.

**Example:**
```
You deposit: 0.1 BTC (when BTC = $50,000)
Value: $5,000

You win big: 0.2 BTC
BTC price drops to $40,000
Value: $8,000 (you still profit, but less)
```

**Strategies to manage volatility:**

### Strategy 1: Play and Withdraw Quickly
- Deposit → Play → Withdraw within hours
- Minimizes exposure to price swings
- Best for: Tournament play or bonus clearing

### Strategy 2: Hold Your Winnings
- Accept that BTC value fluctuates
- Long-term: BTC has historically trended up
- Best for: Investors who believe in BTC

### Strategy 3: Stablecoin Conversion
- Withdraw BTC to stablecoin (USDT, USDC)
- Lock in USD value
- Best for: Risk-averse players

**Our recommendation:** Play with amounts you can afford to hold in BTC. If you need guaranteed USD value, convert to stablecoin after winning.

## Provably Fair Bitcoin Crash Games

**Most Bitcoin crash games are provably fair:**

**How it works:**
1. Casino generates server seed (before round)
2. Casino shows you HASHED server seed
3. You provide client seed (or random)
4. Round plays, multiplier climbs, crashes
5. Casino reveals ACTUAL server seed
6. You verify the round with SHA-256 calculator

**Why Bitcoin makes this better:**
- **Cryptographic by design** — Bitcoin uses SHA-256 hashing
- **Transparency** — All transactions on blockchain
- **Trustless** — No need to trust casino, just the math

**How to verify:**
1. Copy server seed + client seed
2. Go to SHA-256 calculator (search online)
3. Input: `server_seed + client_seed`
4. Compare result to crash point
