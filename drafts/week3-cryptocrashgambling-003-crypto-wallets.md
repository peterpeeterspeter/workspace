## 🔐 Security Best Practices for Crash Gambling Wallets

### 1. Never Share Your Seed Phrase

**Your seed phrase is your master key.** Anyone who has it can steal your funds.

**Rules:**
- ❌ Never share it with anyone (including casino support)
- ❌ Never type it into a website
- ❌ Never store it in cloud storage (Google Drive, iCloud)
- ✅ Write it down on paper and store it safely
- ✅ Use a password manager for wallet passwords

### 2. Use a Dedicated Gambling Wallet

**Don't use your main holding wallet for crash gambling.**

**Instead:**
- Create a separate wallet for gambling
- Keep only what you're willing to lose in it
- Transfer funds from your cold wallet → gambling wallet as needed

**Why:** If your gambling wallet is compromised (or if you deposit at a shady casino), your main stash is safe.

### 3. Enable 2FA (If Available)

Some wallets support 2FA (two-factor authentication):
- **MetaMask:** Connect with Ledger (hardware 2FA)
- **Trust Wallet:** Biometric authentication (fingerprint/Face ID)
- **Ledger:** Physical button press (hardware security)

**Always use 2FA if available.**

### 4. Double-Check Deposit Addresses

**Scam alert:** Some fake crash casinos have similar URLs to legit sites.

**Before depositing:**
- Verify the casino's URL (check for typos)
- Send a small test deposit first
- Confirm it arrived before sending more

## ❓ FAQ: Crypto Wallets for Crash Gambling

### Do crash casinos know my wallet address?

**Yes.** When you deposit, the casino sees your wallet address. However:
- They don't know your identity (unless you KYC)
- They don't have access to your wallet funds
- They can only see transactions on the public blockchain

### Can I use the same wallet for multiple casinos?

**Yes.** Your wallet address is just like an email address—you can use it anywhere. However:
- Some gamblers prefer separate wallets for each casino (for privacy)
- It's easier to track wins/losses with separate wallets

### What happens if I lose my seed phrase?

**Your funds are gone forever.** There's no "forgot password" option with non-custodial wallets. This is why:
- You should write down your seed phrase on paper
- Store multiple copies in safe locations
- Never share it with anyone

### Are hardware wallets worth it for crash gambling?

**If you're gambling with $500+, yes.** Hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor) are unhackable if your seed phrase is safe. For small amounts ($50-100), a hot wallet (MetaMask/Trust Wallet) is fine.

### Can exchanges block my gambling transactions?

**Yes.** Some exchanges (Coinbase, Binance) flag or block gambling-related transactions. **Solution:** Transfer crypto to a no-KYC wallet first, then deposit at casinos.

### What's the best wallet for beginners?

**Trust Wallet (mobile) or Exodus (desktop).** Both are easy to use, support multiple coins, and don't require KYC. Start with Trust Wallet if you're on mobile, Exodus if you're on desktop.

## 🛡️ Responsible Gambling

**Crypto wallets make it easy to deposit fast.** That's dangerous if you're prone to chasing losses.

**Play responsibly:**
- Set a weekly deposit limit (e.g., $100 max)
- Don't deposit more than you can afford to lose
- Use a separate gambling wallet (don't mix with your main funds)
- Take breaks—crash is designed to be addictive

**If you're struggling:**
- **Gamblers Anonymous:** gamblersanonymous.org
- **GamCare:** gamcare.org.uk
- **National Problem Gambling Helpline:** 1-800-522-4700 (US)

## 🔍 Bottom Line

**Best wallet for crash gambling:**
- **Mobile + multi-chain:** Trust Wallet (our top pick)

**Golden rule:** Buy crypto on an exchange → transfer to a no-KYC wallet → deposit at crash casinos.
