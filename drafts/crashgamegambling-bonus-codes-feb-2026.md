## Bonus Terms Explained

### Wagering Requirements

This is how many times you must play through the bonus before withdrawing.

**Example:**
- Bonus: €100
- Wagering: 40x
- You must bet: €100 × 40 = €4,000 total
- Then you can withdraw your winnings

**What counts toward wagering?**
- Crash games: Usually 100% (full contribution)
- Slots: Usually 100%
- Table games: Usually 10-50%

### Minimum Deposit

The smallest amount you can deposit to qualify for the bonus.
- Typical: €10-€20
- Some casinos accept smaller deposits with crypto

### Maximum Cashout

Some bonuses limit how much you can withdraw from bonus winnings.
- Look for: "Unlimited" or no max cashout
- Avoid bonuses with low max cashouts (e.g., "max €100 from €500 bonus")

### Game Restrictions

Make sure crash games count 100% toward wagering. Some bonuses exclude certain games.

## Red Flags to Avoid

### ❌ Fake Bonus Codes

These sites list "exclusive" codes that don't actually work:
- Generic casino directories (they don't test codes)
- Forums with outdated info (codes from 2024)
- "Affiliate spam" sites (any code for commission)

### ❌ Unrealistic Wagering

Avoid bonuses with:
- **70x+ wagering** (nearly impossible to clear)
- **7-day expiration** (not enough time)
- **Max bet €1** (takes forever to clear)

### ❌ Hidden Terms

Watch out for:
- Game restrictions (crash excluded)
- Deposit method restrictions (Skrill/Neteller don't qualify)
- Country restrictions (your country excluded)

## Crash Bonus Strategy

### How to Maximize Bonus Value:

1. **Choose low wagering** (35-40x is standard, avoid 50x+)
2. **Check game contributions** (crash should count 100%)
3. **Calculate expected value:**
   - Bonus €100, wagering 40x = €4,000 total bets
   - House edge 3% = €120 expected loss
   - EV = €100 - €120 = -€20
   - Is it worth it? Only if you'll play anyway

4. **Don't chase losses** — bonuses aren't free money
5. **Read the fine print** — always check terms before depositing

### Pro Tip: Bonus Stacking

Some casinos let you claim:
1. Welcome bonus (first deposit)
2. Reload bonus (second deposit)
3. Free spins (third deposit)

Stack these for maximum value — but only if you were planning to deposit anyway.
