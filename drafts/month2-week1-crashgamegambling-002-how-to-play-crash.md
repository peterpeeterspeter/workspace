## Quick Answer: How Crash Gambling Works (in 30 Seconds)

**Crash is a multiplier game where you bet before the round starts and cash out before the graph crashes.**

1. **Place your bet** ($1-$1,000+)
2. **Watch the multiplier climb** (1.00x → 1.50x → 2.00x → 3.00x...)
3. **Cash out before it crashes** (can crash at ANY moment, even 1.01x)
4. **Win your bet × multiplier** (cash out at 2.00x = double your money)

**The catch:** If you don't cash out before the crash, you lose your entire bet.

**Example:**
- Bet $10, set auto-cashout at 2.00x
- Crash reaches 2.00x → You win $20 (instant)
- Crash crashes at 1.99x → You lose $10

## Part 1: Understanding Crash Game Mechanics

### How Crash Multipliers Work

Crash games use a **random number generator (RNG)** to determine when the crash occurs. The multiplier climbs from 1.00x upward and can crash at **any moment** – even 1.01x or 1.001x.

**Key facts:**
- ✅ **Multipliers are random** – can't be predicted
- ✅ **Crash can happen anytime** – 1.01x, 1.50x, 5.00x, 100.00x
- ✅ **House edge exists** – typically 1-3% (97-99% RTP)
- ✅ **Provably fair** – licensed casinos allow verification

**Crash distribution (typical):**
- **Crash < 1.50x:** ~40% of rounds
- **Crash 1.50x - 3.00x:** ~35% of rounds
- **Crash 3.00x - 10.00x:** ~20% of rounds
- **Crash > 10.00x:** ~5% of rounds

### The House Edge Explained

Casinos make money on crash through the **house edge**:

**Typical crash game:**
- **RTP:** 97-99% (house edge: 1-3%)
- **What this means:** For every $100 wagered, casino pays out $97-$99 long-term
- **Your expected loss:** $1-$3 per $100 wagered

**Example (Stake Crash):**
- House edge: 1% (99% RTP)
- Bet $10 at 2.00x cashout
- Expected win: $9.90 (not $10)
- Long-term: Lose $0.10 per $10 bet

**Why play crash?**
- **Short-term variance** – you can get lucky and win
- **Entertainment value** – crash is exciting
- **Skill element** – auto-cashout and bankroll management matter

├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                     │
│     [GRAPH: Multiplier climbing]    │
│                                     │
│        Current: 1.73x               │

└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**How to bet:**
1. **Enter bet amount:** $1 (recommended for beginners)
2. **Set auto-cashout:** 1.5x or 2.00x (safer targets)
3. **Click "Bet"** to place wager before round starts
4. **Watch multiplier climb** from 1.00x
5. **Manual cashout:** Click "Cash Out" button

## Part 3: Crash Strategy for Beginners

### Strategy 1: Low Multiplier Consistency

**Goal:** Small, consistent wins over time

**Setup:**
- Bet: $1-$5 per round (1-5% of bankroll)
- Auto-cashout: 1.5x or 2.0x
- Stop-loss: Lose 5 rounds in a row → stop for the day

**Why it works:**
- Multipliers hit 1.5x-2.0x frequently (~40-50% of rounds)
- Small bets prevent busting your bankroll
- Auto-cashout removes emotion and greed

**Example:**
- 10 rounds, $2 bet each
- Auto-cashout at 1.5x
- Win 5 rounds = $15 ($2 × 1.5 × 5)
- Lose 5 rounds = $10 ($2 × 5)
- **Net profit:** $5

**Risk:** Low (consistent small wins)

### Strategy 2: Fixed Bet + Stop-Loss

**Goal:** Bankroll management and discipline

**Setup:**
- Bet: $10 every round (fixed)
- Auto-cashout: 2.0x
- Stop-loss: Lose $50 (5 rounds) → stop for the day
- Take-profit: Win $100 → stop and withdraw

**Why it works:**
- Fixed bet size prevents emotional decisions
- Stop-loss prevents chasing losses
- Take-profit locks in winnings

**Example:**
- Start with $100 bankroll
- Bet $10 per round
- After 5 losses ($50 lost): Stop for the day
- After 10 wins ($100 profit): Withdraw and celebrate

**Risk:** Medium (discipline required)

### Strategy 3: Martingale (⚠️ HIGH RISK – Not Recommended!)

**Goal:** Recover losses by doubling bets

**Setup:**
- Start with $1 bet
- If you lose: Double to $2, $4, $8, $16...
- If you win: Reset to $1

**Why it's dangerous:**
- 7 losses in a row = $127 loss (starting from $1)
- Table limits prevent infinite doubling
- One bad run wipes your bankroll

**Example:**
- Round 1: Bet $1, lose → Bankroll: $99
- Round 2: Bet $2, lose → Bankroll: $97
- Round 3: Bet $4, lose → Bankroll: $93
- Round 4: Bet $8, lose → Bankroll: $85
- Round 5: Bet $16, lose → Bankroll: $69
- Round 6: Bet $32, lose → Bankroll: $37
- Round 7: Bet $64, lose → Bankroll: **-$27 (busted)**

**Better alternative:** **Reverse Martingale** (increase bets after wins, not losses).

**Risk:** VERY HIGH (can bust your bankroll fast)

## Part 4: Advanced Crash Tactics

### Tip 1: Watch Crash History

Most crash casinos show **last 100 rounds**:
- **Look for patterns:** (Note: Crash is random, but players still look)
- **Average multiplier:** ~1.97x (theoretical)
- **Hot/cold streaks:** (Psychological, not mathematical)

**Reality check:** Crash is random. History doesn't predict future rounds. But knowing typical multipliers helps set realistic auto-cashout targets.

### Tip 2: Use Auto-Cashout for Discipline

**Manual cashout problems:**
- **Greed:** "Just one more second..." → CRASH → lost
- **Hesitation:** "Should I cash out?" → CRASH → lost
- **Slow reflexes:** Can't click fast enough → CRASH → lost

**Auto-cashout benefits:**
- ✅ **Removes emotion** – no greed, no hesitation
- ✅ **Instant execution** – cashes out at exact target
- ✅ **Consistent strategy** – stick to the plan

**Recommended auto-cashout targets:**
- **Beginners:** 1.5x - 2.0x (high hit rate, lower risk)
- **Intermediate:** 2.0x - 3.0x (moderate risk)
- **Advanced:** 3.0x - 5.0x (higher risk, higher reward)

### Tip 3: Bankroll Management is Everything

**The 1% rule:**
- Never bet more than **1% of your bankroll** per round
- Example: $1,000 bankroll → $10 max bet per round

**The 5% stop-loss:**
- Stop playing after losing **5% of your bankroll**
- Example: $1,000 bankroll → stop after losing $50

**The 10% take-profit:**
- Withdraw after winning **10% of your bankroll**
- Example: $1,000 bankroll → withdraw at $1,100

**Why bankroll management matters:**
- Crash is high-variance – you WILL have losing streaks
- Good bankroll management ensures you survive them
- Bad bankroll management → bust your bankroll fast

## Part 5: Common Crash Gambling Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Chasing Losses

**What it is:** Increasing bets after losses to "win it back"

**Why it's bad:**
- Leads to bigger losses
- Emotional decisions > rational decisions
- Can bust your bankroll in minutes

**What to do instead:**
- Accept losses as part of the game
- Stick to your bet sizing strategy
- Take a break after a losing streak

### ❌ Mistake 2: No Auto-Cashout

**What it is:** Relying on manual cashout every round

**Why it's bad:**
- Human reflexes are too slow for high multipliers
- Greed kicks in ("Just one more second...")
- Hesitation causes missed opportunities

**What to do instead:**
- **Always use auto-cashout** for 80%+ of bets
- Manual cashout only for experienced players with discipline

### ❌ Mistake 3: Betting Too Much Per Round

**What it is:** Betting 10-50% of bankroll per round

**Why it's bad:**
- One losing streak wipes your bankroll
- No room for variance
- Casino has the edge – you'll lose long-term

**What to do instead:**
- **1% rule:** Bet 1% of bankroll per round
- **Never exceed 5%** per round (even for aggressive players)

### ❌ Mistake 4: Ignoring the House Edge

**What it is:** Treating crash as a way to make money, not entertainment

**Why it's bad:**
- Crash has a house edge (1-3%)
- Long-term: you WILL lose money
- Short-term wins feel like skill (but it's luck)

**What to do instead:**
- Treat crash as **paid entertainment**
- Set a budget you're willing to lose
- Walk away when you hit your limit

### ❌ Mistake 5: Playing When Emotional

**What it is:** Gambling while angry, frustrated, or euphoric

**Why it's bad:**
- Emotions cloud judgment
- Leads to bigger bets and riskier plays
- Causes "revenge betting" after losses

**What to do instead:**
- **Take a break** when emotional
- **Don't play when drunk or high**
- **Set time limits** (60 minutes max per session)

## FAQ: How to Play Crash Gambling

### Is crash gambling rigged?
**Answer:** No, if you play at **licensed, provably fair casinos** (Stake, BC.Game, Roobet, etc.). These casinos use **verifiable RNG systems** where each crash round can be verified by players. The house edge is transparent (1-3%), meaning the casino profit comes from math, not rigging. Avoid unlicensed casinos – they CAN rig crash games.

### What's the best crash strategy for beginners?
**Answer:** **Low Multiplier Consistency**:
- Bet 1-5% of bankroll per round
- Set auto-cashout at 1.5x-2.0x
- Stop after 5 losses in a row

This strategy wins ~40-50% of rounds (multipliers hit 1.5x-2.0x frequently) and minimizes risk.

### Can I make money playing crash?
**Answer:** **No, not long-term.** Crash has a house edge (1-3%), meaning you'll lose money over time. Short-term, you can get lucky and win. But crash is **entertainment, not income**. Treat it as paid entertainment with a chance to win – not a way to make money.

### What happens if I don't cash out in time?
**Answer:** You **lose your entire bet**. That's the core mechanic of crash – cash out before the crash or lose everything. Auto-cashout prevents this by cashing out automatically at your target multiplier.

### How much should I bet per round?
**Answer:** Follow the **1% rule**: Never bet more than 1% of your bankroll per round.
- $100 bankroll → $1 max bet
- $1,000 bankroll → $10 max bet
- $10,000 bankroll → $100 max bet

Never exceed 5% of your bankroll per round, even if you're aggressive.

### What's auto-cashout and should I use it?
**Answer:** **Auto-cashout** automatically cashes out at your target multiplier. **Yes, you should use it** for 80%+ of bets because:
- Removes greed and emotion
- Executes instantly (no human delay)
- Enforces discipline

Manual cashout is only for experienced players with strong discipline.

### Is crash gambling legal?
**Answer:** It depends on your country:
- **Legal:** UK, most of EU, Canada (regulated markets)
- **Gray area:** US (offshore casinos accept US players)
- **Illegal:** Some Asian and Middle Eastern countries

**Check your local laws** before gambling. We're not legal experts – this is information, not advice.
