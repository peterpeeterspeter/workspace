- Stop when you hit your limit (win or lose)

**Set Time Limits:**
- Limit crash sessions to 30-60 minutes
- Take breaks between sessions
- Never play when tired, stressed, or emotional

**Use Casino Tools:**
- **Deposit limits:** Set daily/weekly/monthly deposit caps
- **Self-exclusion:** Take a break for 24 hours to 6 months
