## Workflow Standard: All Agents Use Pinch-to-Post (9:41 AM UTC)

**Decision:** Peter requested that ALL agents use pinch-to-post WordPress automation in every workflow.

**Current Setup:**
- pinch-to-post skill: ✅ Enabled and configured
- Sites configured: 4 WordPress sites
  - crashcasino.io (default)
  - crashgamegambling.com
  - freecrashgames.com
  - cryptocrashgambling.com

**Implementation:**
- When spawning sub-agents (sessions_spawn): Include context about pinch-to-post availability
- When delegating tasks: Prefer pinch-to-post over manual WordPress operations
- Training context: All specialist agents (Vision, Fury, Quill) should know about this capability

**Key Features to Leverage:**
- Bulk publish/delete operations
- Content health checks before publishing
- SEO optimization (Yoast/RankMath)
- Markdown to Gutenberg conversion
- Multi-site management

**Action:** Update AGENTS.md with workflow preference documentation.
