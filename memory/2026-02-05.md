## Pending Actions

### CRITICAL - Traffic Leak on crashcasino.io
**Search Console Data (Last 28 days):**

**Top 404 Pages Bleeding Traffic:**
1. `/crash-predictor-bots/` - 29 pageviews, 23 sessions, 56.52% engagement
2. `/2025/05/13/crash-predictor-bots-do-they-work-or-are-they-a-scam/` - 6 pageviews, 11m 41s avg session
3. `/2025/05/crash-predictor-bots/` - 4 pageviews, 16m 57s avg session
4. `/2025/04/09/provably-fair-crash-games/` - 3 pageviews, 100% engagement
5. `/2025/04/09/cash-or-crash-live-review/` - 2 pageviews, 100% engagement
6. `/2025/04/09/jetx-crash-game-review/` - 2 pageviews, 0% engagement

**Performance Issues:**
- LCP: 4.8s (Poor) - page load too slow
- CLS: 0 (Good) - stable layout
- TBT: 40ms (Good) - responsive

**Action Required:**
1. Create "crash predictor bots" content immediately (highest traffic volume)
2. Recreate missing review pages (jetx, cash-or-crash, provably fair)
3. Fix internal links pointing to 404s
4. Optimize page load speed (LCP 4.8s)

### Immediate (Today)
2. **Complete freecrashgames.com** - 8 articles remaining (blocked on image generation)

2. **Delete "Hello World" posts** - Cleanup task
   - All sites have default WordPress posts
   - No SEO value, clutter site

### Previously Identified (from Feb 4)
3. **Duplicate Content** - 3 pairs on crashcasino.io
   - Posts 835/838, 834/837, 833/836
   - Action: Delete older versions or implement 301 redirects

4. **Schema Markup** - Article + FAQPage
5. **Internal Linking** - Build site structure
6. **Title Tag Optimization** - Review and improve

## Important Learning: Tool Usage Policy

**Rule:** **ALWAYS use pinch-to-post for WordPress operations**

**Peter's Directive (09:54 UTC):**
> "yes, always use pinch to post skills for wordpress, this is proven working and should be used always"

**What This Means:**
- ✅ Use pinch-to-post for ALL WordPress tasks
- ❌ NEVER create custom scripts for WordPress operations
- ✅ Pinch-to-post has 50+ features - use them first
- ❌ Custom scripts duplicate functionality and create burden

**Pinch-to-Post Features Available:**
- `fix-affiliate-links <site>` - Replace wrong domains, add missing links
- `bulk-publish <site> <ids>` - Batch publish with quality checks
- `media-upload <site> <file> <alt> <caption> <post_id>` - Image uploads
- `health-check <site> <post_id>` - Quality scoring
- `comment-moderate <site> <action>` - Comment management
- `calendar <year-month> [site]` - Publishing schedule
- `stats [site]` - Content statistics
- `backup <dir> [site]` - Full content export
- And 40+ more features

**Mistake Made This Morning:**
- Created custom `repair-content-smart.py` for HTML/affiliate fixes
- Should have used: `pinch-to-post fix-affiliate-links <site>`

**Correct Workflow Going Forward:**
1. Check if pinch-to-post has the feature (it probably does)
2. Use pinch-to-post command
3. Only create custom scripts for non-WordPress tasks

## Vision Agent Status
