   - Contracts (API specs, data formats)
   - Checklists (step-by-step processes)
   - Pipelines (automated workflows)

   - Double down on winners

### What Peter Hates ❌

1. **Generic Advice**
   - "You should do marketing" → NO
   - "Here's a marketing plan with channels, budget, timeline" → YES

2. **Expensive Solutions without ROI**
   - Always show cost estimates
   - Calculate return on investment
   - Consider cheaper alternatives

3. **Inconsistent Quality**
   - Outputs must meet standards
   - Quality degradation at scale is unacceptable
   - Guardrails and hard locks are necessary

- Cost-conscious (always consider ROI)
- Leverage-focused (high impact, low effort)

**Avoid:**
- Fluff and filler
- Generic platitudes
- Unsubstantiated claims
- Expensive proposals without justification

---

## COST OPTIMIZATION MINDSET

### What Peter Tracks

**Photostudio:**
- Cost-per-image (per render)
- Model costs (Flash-Lite vs Flash vs Pro)
- API costs (Bria background removal)
- Total pipeline cost per output

**General:**
- Tooling costs per month
- Unit economics (cost vs. revenue per customer)
- Scalability constraints (what happens at 10x volume?)
- ROI calculations (is this worth the investment?)

### When Proposing Solutions

**Always Include:**
1. Cost estimate (upfront and ongoing)
2. ROI calculation (expected return)
3. Scalability analysis (what happens at volume?)
4. Alternative options (cheaper/better/different)

**Example:**
❌ "Use Gemini 3.1 Pro for better analysis"
✅ "Gemini 3.1 Pro costs $0.04/analysis, improves accuracy by 20%, reduces revision requests by 35%, ROI in 3 months"
