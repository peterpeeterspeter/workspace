### 2026-02-04 15:50 - Elite Longterm Memory Enabled

**Action:** Installed and enabled elite-longterm-memory skill from ClawdHub

**What Was Done:**
1. Installed elite-longterm-memory v1.2.0 (6-layer system)
2. Created SESSION-STATE.md (HOT RAM layer - active working memory)
3. Setup MEMORY.md + daily/ logs (CURATED ARCHIVE layer - already existed)
4. Installed npm dependencies (131 packages)
5. Created memory/README.md with usage guide

**Layers Now Active:**
- ✅ Layer 1: HOT RAM (SESSION-STATE.md) - Survives compaction
- ⏸️ Layer 2: WARM STORE (LanceDB) - Ready to enable when needed
- ⏸️ Layer 3: COLD STORE (Git-Notes) - Available when needed  
- ✅ Layer 4: CURATED ARCHIVE (MEMORY.md + daily/) - Active
- ⏸️ Layer 5: CLOUD BACKUP (SuperMemory) - Optional
- ⏸️ Layer 6: AUTO-EXTRACTION (Mem0) - Optional

**WAL Protocol Implemented:**
- Write-Ahead Log: Update SESSION-STATE.md BEFORE responding
- Triggers: User preferences, decisions, deadlines, corrections
- Purpose: Prevents context loss from compaction/crashes

**Files Created:**
- `/root/.openclaw/workspace/SESSION-STATE.md` - Hot RAM (3.7 KB)
- `/root/.openclaw/workspace/memory/README.md` - Usage guide (5.1 KB)

**Benefits:**
- Context survives compaction and restarts
- Active working memory always available
- WAL protocol ensures data durability
- Daily logging discipline established

**Next:**
- Start using SESSION-STATE.md for active context tracking
- Continue daily logs
- Extract important lessons to MEMORY.md weekly
