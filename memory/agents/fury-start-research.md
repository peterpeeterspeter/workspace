**Priority:** HIGH
**Time:** 2026-02-02 07:47 UTC
**Tool:** Perplexity Search (configured and tested)

## Your Mission

Run comprehensive competitor research for the 5 crash gambling sites. Use Perplexity Search to gather intelligence on who ranks, what works, and where the opportunities are.

## Research Queries (Run These in Order)

### 1. Core Keyword Clusters

```bash
export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY="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"
cd /workspace/skills/perplexity

# Query 1: General crash gambling
node scripts/search.mjs "best crash gambling sites 2025"

# Query 2: Free/demo angle
node scripts/search.mjs "free crash games no deposit bonus"

# Query 3: Aviator game
node scripts/search.mjs "aviator crash game strategy tips"

# Query 4: Crypto angle
node scripts/search.mjs "crypto crash gambling bitcoin"

# Query 5: Crash game gambling
node scripts/search.mjs "crash game gambling bonus codes"
```

### 2. Competitor Deep-Dives

For each competitor you find, research:
- What content formats they produce (reviews, guides, comparisons?)
- How they monetize (affiliate links, ads, referrals?)
- What's their content quality (thin, thorough, outdated?)
- What they're missing (content gaps, topics not covered)

### 3. Site-Specific Competitors

By each of our sites:
- **crashcasino.io:** Who ranks for "crash casino"?
- **freecrashgames.com:** Who ranks for "free crash games"?
- **aviatorcrashgame.com:** Who ranks for "aviator crash game"?
- **cryptocrashgambling.com:** Who ranks for "crypto crash gambling"?
- **crashgamegambling.com:** Who ranks for "crash game gambling"?

## What to Document

For each query result, capture:

1. **Top 3-5 competitors** (domain names, what they rank for)
2. **Content format analysis** (what type of content ranks?)
3. **Monetization methods** (how do they make money?)
4. **Content quality assessment** (can we beat this?)
5. **Gaps and opportunities** (what's missing that we could exploit?)
