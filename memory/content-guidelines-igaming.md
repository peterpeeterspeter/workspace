# iGaming Content Guidelines - Reusable Spec Pack

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-03
**Purpose:** Universal content guidelines for all iGaming/crash casino articles

---

## A) Global Rules (Apply to Every Article)

### A1) Truth & Evidence Rules
- **DO NOT INVENT:** Tests, audits, datasets, license status, withdrawal times, RTPs, bonus terms, user counts, "verified safe" claims, screenshots, or quotes
- Any claim that could mislead must be:
  - **Sourced** (with link), OR
  - **Qualified** ("we could not verify," "varies by jurisdiction," "example only"), OR
  - **Removed**

### A2) Safety/Defamation-Safe Language
- Don't label brands "rigged/scam" without hard evidence
- Use objective wording:
  - "opaque/unverifiable"
  - "higher risk indicators"
  - "user-reported issues (unverified)"
  - "license not found at time of check"

### A3) Separation of Concerns (Info vs Affiliate)
- **Informational guides:** Max one low-friction CTA block near the end
- **Rankings and "best" lists:** Belong on dedicated pages with rubric + criteria + update date

### A4) Date and Freshness Consistency
- If title includes a year, "Last updated" must be in that year
- Any "current" statements must include check date: "Checked on: YYYY-MM-DD"

### A5) Standard SEO Deliverables (Append to Every Draft)
Include at end:
- SEO title (≤60 chars)
- Meta description (≤155 chars)
- URL slug
- Primary keyword + 3–6 secondary keywords
- Internal links (3–6) to cluster pages
- FAQ candidates (5–10) for FAQ schema
- Suggested featured snippet target paragraph (40–60 words)

### A6) Formatting Rules
- Short paragraphs (1–3 sentences)
- Use bullet lists for steps/checklists
- Tables must render correctly (valid markdown or WP table)
- Avoid repetition; avoid hype

### A7) Required Disclosure Blocks (When Applicable)
- "Not financial advice" for strategy/odds content
- "Affiliate disclosure" when links are monetized
- "Jurisdiction disclaimer" when discussing legality/availability

---

## D) Reusable Blocks (Paste Into Any Article)

### D1) "How We Verify" Block (Generic)
```
We verify licensing and key policy claims by checking the casino's footer/license page and cross-referencing the regulator's public register where available. We check provably fair by reviewing the casino's verification interface and documentation. Checks are dated and may change.
```

### D2) "Data Uncertainty" Disclaimer
```
Some details (fees, processing times, availability) can change by country, payment method, and account status. Where we cannot verify a claim, we mark it as unknown rather than guessing.
```

### D3) "Affiliate Disclosure" Block
```
This page may contain affiliate links. If you use them, we may earn a commission at no extra cost to you. This does not affect how we score or rank brands.
```
