## What Peter Needs to Decide

### Decision 1: Email Service Choice
**Option A: Mailgun (Free Tier)**
- Cost: Free (up to 5,000 emails/month)
- Best for: API automation, technical implementation
- Recommended for: Bootstrapping phase

**Option B: ConvertKit ($9-25/month)**
- Cost: Paid starting at $9/month
- Best for: Visual automation, better analytics
- Recommended for: Marketing-focused approach

**Recommendation:** Start with Mailgun free tier, upgrade later if needed.

### Decision 2: Twitter Account Creation
**Action:** Create @aimusicstore account on Twitter/X
**Time:** ~10 minutes
**Bio:** "Community voting for AI music & tools. Weighted by reputation. Protected from gaming. 🎵 aimusicstore.com"

**Next:** Once created, start posting:
- Teaser: "Building something for AI music creators"
- Share blog post when published
- Engage with AI music community

### Decision 3: Agent Coordination
**Question:** Should Vision, Fury, and Quill start their tasks now?
- Vision: Keyword research for AI music space
- Fury: Competitor analysis (Product Hunt, Reddit, AI music sites)
- Quill: Partnership outreach (Suno, Udio, Mubert, etc.)

**Recommendation:** Yes, unblock them to start. Research can happen in parallel.
