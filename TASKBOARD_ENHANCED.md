## 🎯 HANDOFF PROTOCOL

### How Handoffs Work:

1. **Task Creation** - Agent creates task in ASSIGNED
2. **Work Begins** - Move to IN PROGRESS
3. **Ready for Next Agent** - Add to "Handoff to:" field
4. **Notification** - System auto-mentions next agent
5. **Handoff Complete** - Next agent acknowledges and starts

### Handoff Rules:

- **Always** specify who you're handing off to
- **Always** link to relevant files
- **Always** mention what dependencies are resolved
- **Never** hand off incomplete work without noting what's pending

### Common Handoff Patterns:

```
@Fury (Research) → @Vision (SEO Analysis) → @Loki (Drafting) → @Vision (Review) → @Quill (Promotion)
```
