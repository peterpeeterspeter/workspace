## Action Required

### Priority 1: URGENT - crashgame & freecrash (60+ posts combined)

**Action:** Add affiliate links to ALL published posts on both sites

**Approach:**
1. Identify each post type (guide, review, comparison)
2. Insert "Recommended Crypto Casinos" section near end
3. Add contextually relevant affiliate links
4. Test links after insertion

**Estimated effort:** 60-90 posts × 15 minutes = 15-22 hours work

### Priority 2: MEDIUM - crashcasino (13 posts missing links)

**Action:** Add affiliate links to remaining 13 posts

**Note:** Some posts may be duplicates (835/838, 834/837, 833/836) - consider consolidating or redirecting

**Estimated effort:** 13 posts × 15 minutes = 3-4 hours work

### Priority 3: LOW - cryptocrash (29+ posts missing links)

**Action:** Add affiliate links to remaining posts

**Estimated effort:** 29 posts × 15 minutes = 7-8 hours work

4. 7Bit Casino
5. Mirax Casino
6. TrustDice

## Technical Implementation

I can create an automation script to:
1. Fetch all published posts from each site
2. Check for affiliate link presence
3. Identify insertion points (before conclusion)
4. Insert affiliate section with proper formatting
5. Update posts via WordPress REST API
6. Verify links after insertion

**Would you like me to proceed with automation or manual updates?**

## Next Steps

**Option A: Full automation** - I create a script to batch-update all posts
**Option B: Manual priority** - We tackle highest-traffic posts first
**Option C: Site-by-site** - Fix one site completely before moving to next
**Option D: Article type** - Fix all "Best of" lists first, then guides

Which approach would you prefer?
