### Content Gaps Identified

#### Gap 1: Bonus Terms & Wagering Requirements Deep Dive
**What's Missing:** None of the top competitors thoroughly explain:
- How wagering requirements work specifically for crash games
- Which crash games contribute 100% vs 5% to wagering
- Game weightings for bonus clearance
- Strategy for clearing bonuses with crash games
- Time limits for bonus wagering

**Opportunity:** Create "Crash Game Bonus Strategy" content explaining how to actually clear bonuses playing crash.

#### Gap 2: Crash-Specific Bonus Types
**What's Missing:** No content dedicated to:
- Crash-specific promotions (tournaments, leaderboards, multiplier races)
- Live crash bonus events
- Crypto crash bonuses vs fiat crash bonuses
- Crash game free spin conversions

**Opportunity:** Coverage of unique crash game promotions not found elsewhere.

#### Gap 3: Bonus Comparison by Crash Game Variant
**What's Missing:** Content comparing bonuses across:
- Aviator-specific bonuses
- Thunder Crash promotions
- Space Crasher offers
- Dragon's Crash deals

**Opportunity:** Game-specific bonus breakdowns (e.g., "Best Bonuses for Aviator Players").

#### Gap 4: No Deposit Bonus Strategy for Crash
**What's Missing:** While no-deposit bonuses are mentioned, no content explains:
- How to find crash-exclusive no-deposit offers
- Which casinos offer crash game no-deposit bonuses
- Converting no-deposit winnings on crash games
- Withdrawal limits and conditions

**Opportunity:** Dedicated "Crash No-Deposit Bonus Guide" with actionable strategy.

#### Gap 5: Geographic/Regional Bonus Variations
**What's Missing:** None of the competitors address:
- Country-specific crash bonuses
- Geo-restricted promotions
- VPN-friendly crash casinos
- Regional wagering requirement differences

**Opportunity:** Geo-targeted bonus content (e.g., "Crash Bonuses for [Country] Players").
