## 1. crashcasino.io — "The Trust & Safety Guide"

## Cross-Site Strategy

### Content Distribution (What Goes Where?)

| Content Type | Primary Site | Secondary Sites | Rationale |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Fairness/Rigging audits** | crashcasino.io | — | Trust angle unique |
| **Country-specific guides** | freecrashgames.com | — | Geo-focused |
| **Aviator-specific content** | aviatorcrashgame.com | — | Game-specific |
| **Coin-specific crash guides** | cryptocrashgambling.com | — | Crypto-focused |
| **Beginner education** | crashgamegambling.com | — | Academy angle |
| **"Best crash casinos" listicles** | All 5 sites | Each with unique angle | Commercial intent, differentiated |
| **Strategy content** | crashgamegambling.com (educational) | aviatorcrashgame.com (Aviator-specific) | Split by purpose |
| **Provably fair explanations** | crashcasino.io | crashgamegambling.com (basic) | Depth vs. beginner |

### Cross-Linking Strategy

**RECOMMENDATION:** Limited cross-linking, mainly for:
- crashgamegambling.com (beginners) → specific sites for deeper dives
- All sites → crashcasino.io for fairness audits (trust signal)

**AVOID:** Heavy interlinking that looks like a PBN (private blog network). Google hates link networks.

### Affiliate Positioning

**Different casinos OR different angles:**
- Same casinos can appear on all sites, but with different positioning
- crashcasino.io: "Most trusted crash casinos (verified fair)"
- freecrashgames.com: "Best crash casinos for [country]"
- aviatorcrashgame.com: "Best Aviator casinos (VIP, low min, etc.)"
- cryptocrashgambling.com: "Best crypto crash casinos (by coin)"
- crashgamegambling.com: "Beginner-friendly crash casinos"

**Rationale:** Different CTAs, different hooks, same casinos (if they're legit).
