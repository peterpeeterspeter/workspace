# Self-Improving Agent

**Version:** 1.1.0
**Author:** pskoett
**Source:** https://github.com/peterskoett/self-improving-agent

Log learnings and errors to markdown files for continuous improvement. Coding agents can later process these into fixes, and important learnings get promoted to project memory.

---

## Quick Reference

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Command/operation fails | Log to `.learnings/ERRORS.md` |
| User corrects you | Log to `.learnings/LEARNINGS.md` with category `correction` |
| User wants missing feature | Log to `.learnings/FEATURE_REQUESTS.md` |
| API/external tool fails | Log to `.learnings/ERRORS.md` with integration details |
| Knowledge was outdated | Log to `.learnings/LEARNINGS.md` with category `knowledge_gap` |
| Found better approach | Log to `.learnings/LEARNINGS.md` with category `best_practice` |

---

## Promotion Guide

| Learning Type | Promote To | Example |
|---------------|------------|---------|
| Behavioral patterns | `SOUL.md` | "Be concise, avoid disclaimers" |
| Workflow improvements | `AGENTS.md` | "Spawn sub-agents for long tasks" |
| Tool gotchas | `TOOLS.md` | "Git push needs auth configured first" |

---
```

---

## ID Generation

**Format:** `TYPE-YYYYMMDD-XXX`

- **TYPE:** `LRN` (learning), `ERR` (error), `FEAT` (feature)
- **YYYYMMDD:** Current date
- **XXX:** Sequential number or random 3 chars (e.g., `001`, `A7B`)

**Examples:**
- `LRN-20250115-001`
- `ERR-20250115-A3F`
- `FEAT-20250115-002`

---

## Resolving Entries

When an issue is fixed, update the entry:

1. Change `Status: pending` → `Status: resolved`
2. Add resolution block after Metadata:

```markdown
### Resolution
- Resolved: 2025-01-16T09:00:00Z
- Commit/PR: abc123 or #42
- Notes: Brief description of what was done
```

**Other status values:**
- `in_progress` - Actively being worked on
- `wont_fix` - Decided not to address (add reason in Resolution notes)
- `promoted` - Elevated to `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

---

## Promoting to Project Memory

When a learning is broadly applicable (not a one-off fix), promote it to permanent project memory.

### When to Promote

- Learning applies across multiple files/features
- Knowledge any contributor (human or AI) should know
- Prevents recurring mistakes
- Documents project-specific conventions

### Promotion Targets

| Target | What Belongs There |
|--------|-------------------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Project facts, conventions, gotchas for all Claude interactions |
| `AGENTS.md` | Agent-specific workflows, tool usage patterns, automation rules |
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Project context and conventions for GitHub Copilot |
| `SOUL.md` | Behavioral guidelines, communication style, principles (OpenClaw workspace) |
| `TOOLS.md` | Tool capabilities, usage patterns, integration gotchas (OpenClaw workspace) |

### How to Promote

1. Distill the learning into a concise rule or fact
2. Add to appropriate section in target file (create file if needed)
3. Update original entry: Change `Status: pending` → `Status: promoted`
4. Add `Promoted: CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

### Promotion Examples

**Learning (verbose):**
> Project uses pnpm workspaces. Attempted `npm install` but failed. Lock file is `pnpm-lock.yaml`. Must use `pnpm install`.

**In CLAUDE.md (concise):**
```markdown
## Build & Dependencies
- Package manager: pnpm (not npm)
- use `pnpm install`
```

**Learning (verbose):**
> When modifying API endpoints, must regenerate TypeScript client. Forgetting this causes type mismatches at runtime.

**In AGENTS.md (actionable):**
```markdown
## After API Changes
1. Regenerate client: `pnpm run generate:api`
2. Check for type errors: `pnpm tsc --noEmit`
```

---

## Recurring Pattern Detection

If logging something similar to an existing entry:

1. **Search first:** `grep -r "keyword" .learnings/`
2. **Link entries:** Add `See Also: ERR-20250110-001` in Metadata
3. **Bump priority** if issue keeps recurring
4. **Consider systemic fix:** Recurring issues often indicate:
   - Missing documentation (→ promote to `CLAUDE.md` or `.github/copilot-instructions.md`)
   - Missing automation (→ add to `AGENTS.md`)
   - Architectural problem (→ create tech debt ticket)

---

## Periodic Review

Review `.learnings/` at natural breakpoints:

### When to Review
- Before starting a new major task
- After completing a feature
- When working in an area with past learnings
- Weekly during active development

### Quick Status Check

```bash
# Count pending items
grep -h "Status\*\*: pending" .learnings/*.md | wc -l

# List pending high-priority items
grep -B5 "Priority\*\*: high" .learnings/*.md | grep "^## \["

# Find learnings for a specific area
grep -l "Area\*\*: backend" .learnings/*.md
```

### Review Actions
- Resolve fixed items
- Promote applicable learnings
- Link related entries
- Escalate recurring issues

---

## Detection Triggers

Automatically log when you notice:

**Corrections** (→ learning with `correction` category):
- "No, that's not right..."
- "Actually, it should be..."
- "You're wrong about..."
- "That's outdated..."

**Feature Requests** (→ feature request):
- "Can you also..."
- "I wish you could..."
- "Is there a way to..."
- "Why can't you..."

**Knowledge Gaps** (→ learning with `knowledge_gap` category):
- User provides information you didn't know
- Documentation you referenced is outdated
- API behavior differs from your understanding

**Errors** (→ error entry):
- Command returns non-zero exit code
- Exception or stack trace
- Unexpected output or behavior
- Timeout or connection failure

---

## Priority Guidelines

| Priority | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| **critical** | Blocks core functionality, data loss risk, security issue |
| **high** | Significant impact, affects common workflows, recurring issue |
| **medium** | Moderate impact, workaround exists |
| **low** | Minor inconvenience, edge case, nice-to-have |

---

## Area Tags

Use to filter learnings by codebase region:

| Area | Scope |
|------|-------|
| **frontend** | UI, components, client-side code |
| **backend** | API, services, server-side code |
| **infra** | CI/CD, deployment, Docker, cloud |
| **tests** | Test files, testing utilities, coverage |
| **docs** | Documentation, comments, READMEs |
| **config** | Configuration files, environment, settings |

---

## Best Practices

1. **Log immediately** - context is freshest right after the issue
2. **Be specific** - future agents need to understand quickly
3. **Include reproduction steps** - especially for errors
4. **Link related files** - makes fixes easier
5. **Suggest concrete fixes** - not just "investigate"
6. **Use consistent categories** - enables filtering
7. **Promote aggressively** - if in doubt, add to `CLAUDE.md` or `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
8. **Review regularly** - stale learnings lose value

---

## Gitignore Options

- **Keep learnings local** (per-developer): `.learnings/`
- **Track learnings in repo** (team-wide): Don't add to `.gitignore` - learnings become shared knowledge.
- **Hybrid** (track templates, ignore entries):
  ```
  .learnings/*.md
  !.learnings/.gitkeep
  ```
