### Aidescribe.com
**Status:** Demand Validation Complete - Decision Point
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-14 21:51 UTC
**Research Completed:** DataForSEO + last30days

**Key Findings:**
- Search volume: 10/month (too weak for SEO-only)
- Commercial intent: High ($9.31 CPC for related terms)
- Competition: Low (keyword difficulty 0-6/100)
- Market: Enterprise solutions exist (Hypotenuse AI, Mirakl, Rubick.ai)
- Gap: No apparel-focused SMB tool (Shopify merchants underserved)

**Recommended Vertical:** Apparel/Fashion (women's tops for MVP)
**Next Steps:**
- Option A: Validate with 20 Shopify apparel merchants (direct outreach)
- Option B: Build MVP for women's tops attributes
- Option C: Pause project (low organic demand)

**Decision Awaiting:** Peter's direction on validation vs. building
