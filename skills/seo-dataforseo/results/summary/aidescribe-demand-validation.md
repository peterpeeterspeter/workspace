---

## Recommendations

### 1. **Validate with Direct Outreach** (Do this first)

**Target: 10-20 ecom teams**

**Script:**
> "Hi [Name], I'm building a tool that reads product photos and automatically extracts attributes (size, color, material, etc.) for your catalog. Would you be willing to test it for free? Takes 2 minutes to upload a photo."

**Where to find them:**
- Shopify merchants (search "shop" on Google, find contact)
- Ecom agencies (huge leverage - they manage 100+ stores)
- LinkedIn: "ecommerce manager" or "product catalog manager"
- Reddit: r/ecommerce, r/shopify

**What to learn:**
- Do they have this problem?
- How do they currently solve it?
- Would they pay for automated solution?
- What price per item makes sense?

### 2. **Test Different Keyword Phrasing**

Research these terms (we missed some):

| Industry Term | Search Volume to Check |
|---------------|------------------------|
| "product image recognition software" | Unknown |
| "packshot data entry" | Unknown |
| "product catalog automation" | Unknown |
| "merchant feed optimization" | Unknown |
| "Google Shopping attribute extraction" | Unknown |
| "ecommerce product tagging" | Unknown |

### 3. **Competitive Deep Dive**

Analyze these tools (what do they actually do?):

1. **Google Product Studio** - Does Google already offer this?
2. **ChatGPT/Claude Vision** - Can people just upload photos manually?
3. **Magento/Shopify plugins** - Any existing automation?
4. **Pimberly, Salsify** - Enterprise PIM solutions - do they have vision features?

### 4. **Market Positioning**

Based on signals:

**Position as:** "The missing piece in your ecom stack"

**Messaging:**
- Problem: "You have 1,000 product photos and no structured data"
- Solution: "Upload photos → Get attributes mapped to Google Merchant Center"
- Outcome: "Save 20 hours/week, launch products 3x faster"

**Target:** Shopify merchants with 100-5,000 products (sweet spot: pain is real, can't afford enterprise PIM)

## Next Steps (Prioritized)

### Week 1: Direct Validation
- [ ] Reach out to 20 ecom teams (DM, email, LinkedIn)
- [ ] Offer free beta access in exchange for feedback
- [ ] Learn: Do they have the problem? How painful is it? What would they pay?

### Week 2: Additional Research
- [ ] Research alternative keyword terms (above list)
- [ ] Analyze 3-5 competitors (Pimberly, Salsify, Google Product Studio)
- [ ] Test: Upload product photos to GPT-4V manually → How good is baseline?

### Week 3: Decision

**IF 10+ teams say "yes this is a problem, I'd pay €0.05/item":**
- Build MVP (4 weeks)
- Launch to warm leads (beta testers)
- Position as "product attribute extraction from photos"

**IF response is lukewarm or "we don't have this problem":**
- Pivot or pause
- Problem may be less painful than assumed
- Or wrong ICP (maybe target agencies, not merchants)

---

## Risk Factors

### High Risk 🔴

1. **Google may release this for free**
   - Google Product Studio could add "auto-attribute extraction"
   - They have the vision models + merchant feed integration

2. **ChatGPT/Claude Vision may be "good enough"**
   - Manual upload + prompt is free/cheap
   - Why pay if you can do it yourself with AI?

### Medium Risk 🟡

3. **Wrong ICP**
   - Maybe agencies are the real customer (manage 100s of stores)
   - Or enterprise PIM users (not Shopify merchants)

4. **Not painful enough**
   - Merchants may tolerate manual entry
   - Or they have low product counts (<100), so automation doesn't matter

### Low Risk 🟢

5. **Technical feasibility**
   - Vision models are good enough today
   - Mapping to merchant feeds is straightforward
   - This is buildable

---

## Conclusion

**Demand Validation:** ⚠️ **WEAK ORGANIC DEMAND, BUT REAL PROBLEM**

**The Good:**
- High commercial intent in related AI product tools ($9.31 CPC)
- Low competition (easy to rank)
- Problem clearly exists (manual attribute entry sucks)

**The Bad:**
- Near-zero search volume for exact problem
- People don't know to search for this solution
- Declining trend in broader AI product tools

**The Ugly:**
- Risk of Google/GPT releasing this for free
- May be a feature, not a product

**Recommendation:**
✅ **Proceed with direct validation first** (outreach to 20 ecom teams)
❌ **Don't build based on SEO signals alone** (too weak)

**If 10+ teams validate:**
- Build MVP focused on **one vertical** (apparel or electronics)
- Position as **"product attribute extraction for Shopify"**
- Price: **€0.05/item** or **€29/month subscription**

**If validation fails:**
- Pivot to **agencies** (B2B2C model) or pause this idea
