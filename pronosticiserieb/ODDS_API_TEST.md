# Odds-API.io Key Received

## API Key: 67972a4c030e6c39332b1b34f3994811

## Testing Results

### ✅ Working Endpoints:
- `/sports` - Lists all sports (works!)
- `/bookmakers` - Lists bookmakers (working)

### ❌ Not Working (Possibly Tier Limitation):
- `/events/search` - "You need to provide a valid apiKey"
- `/odds` - "You need to provide a valid apiKey"

## Analysis

This suggests the API key might be:
1. **Free tier** with limited access
2. **Requires upgrade** for events/odds endpoints
3. **Trial key** with restrictions

## What We Can Confirm:

✅ **Football is available** as a sport
✅ **API key is valid** (works for some endpoints)
❌ **Unclear if Serie B odds are available** without testing /odds endpoint

## Next Steps:

1. **Check odds-api.io account** - Log in and see:
   - What tier/plan is this key?
   - What endpoints are included?
   - Usage/limits remaining?

2. **Alternative: Use API-Football**
   - Confirmed Serie B coverage
   - Free tier includes fixtures/standings
   - Can add odds later (paid tier)

3. **Or: Use BOTH**
   - API-Football for fixtures/standings (free)
   - Odds-API for bookmaker odds (if tier allows)

## Recommendation:

**For now:**
- Sign up for API-Football (free, confirmed Serie B)
- Use Odds-API key if we can upgrade tier
- Test both APIs in parallel
