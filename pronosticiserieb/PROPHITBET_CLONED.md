## 🔧 Next Steps (Waiting for API-Football Key)

### **Step 1: Install Dependencies** (When Ready)
```bash
cd /root/.openclaw/workspace/pronosticiserieb/ProphitBet-Soccer-Bets-Predictor
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Or: python install.py
```

### **Step 2: Understand Data Format** (5 min)
```bash
# Check their expected data structure
cat README.md | grep -A 20 "Data Format"
# Look at example files in storage/
```

### **Step 3: Adapt for Serie B** (1 hour)
```python
# We'll need to:
# 1. Fetch Serie B data from API-Football
# 2. Format it for ProphitBet
