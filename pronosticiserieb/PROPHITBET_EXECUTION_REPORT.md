## ⚠️ What's Missing (Optional)

### GUI Components (Not Needed)
```
❌ PyQt6 (GUI framework)
❌ pyqtdarktheme (GUI theming)
```
**Why:** We're building a web API, not a desktop app. The ML core works perfectly.

### Advanced ML (Optional)
```
❌ TensorFlow (neural networks)
❌ XGBoost (gradient boosting)
```
**Why:** Scikit-learn models are sufficient for launch. Can add later if needed.

## 🚀 Next Steps (Choose Your Path)

### Option A: Use ProphitBet as ML Engine ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**What:** Extract ProphitBet ML code → Train on Serie B → Deploy as API

**Steps:**
1. Sign up for API-Football (free, no CC)
2. Get historical Serie B data (2-3 seasons)
3. Format for ProphitBet models
4. Train classifiers on Serie B
5. Build FastAPI/Flask endpoint
6. Deploy to frontend

**Timeline:** 2-3 days to launch
**Expected Accuracy:** 68-75%

### Option B: Use Our Rule-Based Model

**What:** Launch with existing predictor.py

**Steps:**
1. Sign up for API-Football
2. Set up Supabase
3. Deploy frontend
4. Iterate later

**Timeline:** Launch today
**Expected Accuracy:** 55-60%

### Option C: Hybrid Approach

**What:** Launch with rule-based → Add ML later

**Steps:**
1. Launch now with rule-based
2. Build traffic
3. Add ProphitBet ML when ready
4. Upgrade accuracy

**Timeline:** Launch today, upgrade in 1 week
