# 🎰 UPDATED: Two API Strategy

## What We Have Now

### **Odds-API.io** (Your key)
**API Key:** `67972a4c030e6c39332b1b34f3994811`

**Working:**
- ✅ `/sports` endpoint - Football available
- ✅ `/bookmakers` endpoint - 200+ bookmakers
- ✅ **Italian bookmakers found:**
  - 888Sport IT
  - AdmiralBet IT
  - BetFlag IT

**Not Working (likely tier limitation):**
- ❌ `/events` - Needs higher tier
- ❌ `/events/search` - Needs higher tier
- ❌ `/odds` - Needs higher tier

**Action Required:** Check your odds-api.io dashboard to see:
- What tier/plan is this key?
- Can we upgrade for odds access?
- What's the cost for odds endpoints?

---

### **API-Football** (Need to sign up)
**URL:** https://www.api-football.com

**Advantages:**
- ✅ **Confirmed Serie B coverage**
- ✅ **Free tier includes:**
  - Fixtures (upcoming matches)
  - Standings (league table)
  - Team statistics
- ✅ **Paid tier adds:**
  - H2H statistics
  - Odds data
  - Predictions API

**Cost:** Free → Paid (when needed)

## 🚀 New Launch Strategy: Use BOTH APIs

### **Phase 1: Launch with API-Football (This Week)**
```
Sign up for API-Football (free)
Get Serie B: fixtures + standings
Launch site with real match data
Add predictions from our model
```

### **Phase 2: Add Odds from Odds-API (When Tier Upgraded)**
```
Check your odds-api.io account tier
Upgrade if needed for /odds endpoint
Add live bookmaker quotes
Enable value bet detection
Link affiliate URLs to bookmakers
```

---

## 🎯 Best Path Forward

### **Option A: Quick Launch (Recommended)**
1. **Sign up for API-Football** (free, 5 min)
2. **Launch with fixtures + predictions** (2 days)
3. **Add odds later** (when Odds-API tier upgraded or separate purchase)

**Timeline:** Launch this week, add odds next week

---

### **Option B: Check Odds-API Tier First**
1. **Log in to odds-api.io** dashboard
2. **Check what tier your key is on**
3. **See if /odds endpoint is included**
4. **If yes:** Use Odds-API from start
5. **If no:** Upgrade or use API-Football

**Timeline:** 1 day to check, then proceed

---

### **Option C: Hybrid (Fastest)**
1. **Sign up for API-Football** (free)
2. **Launch NOW** with fixtures
3. **Test Odds-API /odds** endpoint directly with specific match ID
4. **Add odds** if we can get it working

**Timeline:** Launch today, debug odds in parallel

---

## 🔧 Let Me Test Something

I can try to fetch odds for a specific event if you give me a match ID.

Or I can use **browser access** (you mentioned I have it) to:
- Access odds-api.io dashboard directly
- See what endpoints are available
- Check usage/tier information

---

## 💡 My Recommendation

**Do both in parallel:**

**Right now:**
- Sign up for API-Football (5 min)
- I'll build with fixtures/standings
- We launch in 2 days

**Meanwhile:**
- Check your odds-api.io dashboard (what tier?)
- Or give me browser access to check
- We'll integrate odds when we can

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Launch faster (not waiting on odds)
- ✅ Live data from day 1 (fixtures are live)
- ✅ Add odds when ready (upgrade or debug)
- ✅ Build audience first, monetize fully later
