## 📈 TESTING STRATEGY

### Week 1: Test & Learn
1. **Post both videos** with different captions (use Option 1 on video 1, Option 2 on video 2)
2. **Post 2-3 times per day** at different times (9 AM, 12 PM, 6 PM CET)
3. **Rotate captions** - test all 10 options over the week
4. **Track metrics:**
   - View completion rate (do they watch the full 15 seconds?)
   - Click-through rate (link in bio clicks)
   - Shares (is it shareable?)
   - Saves (do they want to remember it?)

### Week 2: Double Down
1. Identify **top 2 performing captions**
2. Create more videos with similar hooks
3. Post winning captions during peak times
4. A/B test CTA variations ("Link in bio" vs "Try it free" vs "Start now")

### Week 3: Scale
1. Create variations: different garments, different angles
2. Add text overlays to videos (brand name, key benefit)
3. Test trending sounds/music
4. Cross-post to Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts
