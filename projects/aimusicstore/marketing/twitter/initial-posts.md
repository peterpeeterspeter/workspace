## Post 4 (Differentiation) - Day 4

**Tweet:**
```
Most voting systems:

1 person = 1 vote

Easy to game with bots.

Our system:

Weighted voting by reputation

Anti-gaming protection

Real-time rankings

Coming soon.

#AIMusic #Tech #ProductLaunch
```

**Rationale:** Explains our unique value proposition. Shows why we're different from Product Hunt, Reddit, etc.

## Post 5 (Behind the Scenes) - Day 5

**Tweet:**
```
Working on an anti-gaming voting system for AI music.

Because fake rankings ruin discovery for everyone.

The problem: Bot accounts, coordinated attacks, paid placements.

The solution: Reputation-weighted voting + manipulation detection.

Building in public. Follow for updates.

#AIMusic #BuildInPublic #Startup
```

**Rationale:** "Building in public" angle. Shows thought process and technical approach. Transparency builds trust.
