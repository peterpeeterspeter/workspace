# aimusicstore Email Welcome Sequence

**Platform:** TBD (awaiting Peter's choice: Mailgun free tier vs ConvertKit)
**Trigger:** User joins waitlist via coming soon page
**Goal:** Convert waitlist → active voters at launch

---

## Email 1: Welcome + What to Expect

**Send:** Immediately (when they join waitlist)
**Subject:** Welcome to aimusicstore 🎵

**Body:**

```
Hey [Name],

You're on the list! 👋

Thanks for joining the aimusicstore waitlist. We're building something different:

A community-powered voting platform for AI music that's actually immune to gaming.

**What makes aimusicstore different:**

• Weighted voting — reputation matters, not just vote count
• Anti-gaming system — real-time attack detection and prevention
• Full transparency — every vote is visible and scored

No more fake rankings. No more upvote bots. No more wondering if that #1 track earned it fairly.

**What happens next:**

1. We're launching in phases (early access → full launch)
2. You'll get an invite when it's your turn
3. Early adopters get a reputation boost (more voting power from day 1)

**While you wait:**

## Email 2: Behind the Scenes (Anti-Gaming System)

**Send:** 2 days after signup
**Subject:** How we're fixing AI music rankings 🛡️

**Body:**

```
Hey [Name],

Quick question:

Have you ever noticed that "top ranked" AI music tracks are... suspiciously mediocre?

Yeah, me too.

Here's why: **Current ranking systems are broken.**

• Upvote bots can create 100 fake accounts in 10 minutes
• Creators boost their own tracks with voting rings
• Discord servers coordinate mass-upvotes for specific tracks

The result? Rankings reflect effort, not quality.

---

**So I built aimusicstore differently.**

Here's what happens when someone tries to game our system:

**Scenario 1: The Botnet Attack**
10,000 votes for the same track within 2 minutes
→ Anti-gaming system detects the anomaly
→ Votes are flagged and discounted
→ Attacker's reputation is penalized
→ Attack is logged in transparency report

**Scenario 2: The Discord Coordination**
50 users from same Discord all vote identically
→ Behavioral analysis detects the pattern
→ Weighted scoring dilutes the impact
→ Reputation system discourages blind voting
→ Legitimate community votes still count

**Scenario 3: The Self-Voter**
Creator makes 20 accounts to upvote their own track
→ IP tracking flags multiple accounts from same source
→ Email verification prevents mass account creation
→ Reputation gating means new accounts have zero influence
→ Time cost to game > 6 months of genuine activity

---

**Why this matters:**

When you explore aimusicstore rankings, you can trust them.

Every vote is:
• Timestamped (see exactly when it happened)
• Attributed (know who voted and their reputation)
• Scored (understand the weighted calculation)

No black boxes. No hidden algorithms. Just transparent, community-driven rankings.

**Option 1: Mailgun (Free Tier)**
- Cost: Free (up to 5,000 emails/month)

- Cons: Manual list management, basic analytics
- Best for: Technical implementation, API automation

**Option 2: ConvertKit (Paid)**
- Cost: ~$9/month starting
- Pros: Visual automation builder, better analytics, subscriber segmentation
